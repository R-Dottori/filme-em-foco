Derrick Jr.', 'Jason Hand', 'Dana Ledoux Miller']","['Jared Bush', 'Dana Ledoux Miller', 'Bek Smith']","[""Auli'i Cravalho"", 'Dwayne Johnson', 'Hualalai Chung']",7.1,17000.0,"Após receber um chamado de seus ancestrais, Moana parte em uma jornada nos mares distantes da Oceania, desbravando águas perigosas, rumo a uma aventura diferente de todas as que já viveu.","['Animação', 'Aventura', 'Comédia', 'Família', 'Fantasia', 'Musical']",150000000,386300000,"['The original Moana was a film that surprised me. I thought it was great. It was brimming with heart, humour, and unforgettable songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The performances, especially from Dwayne Johnson as Maui and Auli i Cravalho as Moana, brought the characters to life in a way that felt fresh. Naturally, I was eager to see how a sequel would expand on the magic of the first movie. However, Moana 2, while enjoyable, doesn\'t quite recapture the same magic that made the original such a standout to me.\n\nOne of the biggest differences is in the music. With Miranda not returning to compose the songs, the sequel lacks the same level of musical brilliance. The new songs are decent and serviceable, but they don\'t have the catchy, emotionally resonant quality that made tracks like ""How Far I\'ll Go"" unforgettable. While the tunes in Moana 2 are pleasant, they fail to leave a lasting impression, making the musical aspect of the film feel less integral to the overall experience.\n\nThe story, too, feels like a weaker reflection of the original. Without delving into spoilers, the plot revisits themes and beats that feel overly familiar, which might leave fans unsatisfied. That said, the ending provides a heartfelt resolution that ties everything together in a satisfying way. Despite losing momentum in the middle, the final act does a great job of recapturing the story\'s emotional core, leaving me curious about what future adventures could look like.\n\nVisually, Moana 2 is a feast for the eyes. The animation remains top-tier, with solid visuals of the ocean, lush islands, and intricate details that make the world feel vibrant and alive. While the sequel doesn\'t quite reach the heights of the original in terms of story or music, it\'s still an enjoyable watch. For fans of the first film, it\'s worth checking out, even if it doesn\'t fully live up to its predecessor.', ""Riding high on a wave of stunning animation even when its story runs adrift, Moana 2 isn't as inspired as the original but still delights as a colorful adventure.\n\nSeriously, it's the only WDAS film since Moana 1 that I'd give a passing grade to. Ralph 2 was an utter failure of a sequel, Frozen 2 was a structural mess that got carried by its name, Raya botched its message so badly that it overwhelmed the good elements, Strange World was brutal with its boring exposition and muddled themes, and Wish is the first ever Disney film that had terrible music (along with the plot messiness commonplace in films written by Jennifer Lee). We're nearing a decade-worth of films that I'd grade as 6/10 or worse, the lone exception being Encanto."", '""Moana 2"" has to be one of the most unexpected sequels in recent memory. It only came to my attention earlier this year when Disney announced they retooled a TV show that continues the original film\'s story into a theatrically released sequel. That\'s not even mentioning that they\'re releasing a live-action remake in 2026. The original ""Moana"" is an incredible film with spectacular voice acting from Auli\'i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson as Moana and Maui, dazzling animation, iconic songs in ""How Far I\'ll Go"" and ""You\'re Welcome,"" a legendary side-character in Schaffrillas...I mean Tamatoa and an engaging narrative. I was curious to see how a sequel would work, and after seeing it, I realized one hard truth: I\'m not the target audience.\n\nFor the positives, the voice acting is still remarkable, with Cravalho and Johnson again delivering energetic performances. Even though the story is not the strongest, which we\'ll get to, their work manages to get me somewhat invested.\n\nOf course, the animation is phenomenal. Disney films have always been known for their terrific animation, so it goes without saying that ""Moana 2"" is no different.\n\nWhile this film does not have as many memorable songs as the first, ""Can I Get A Chee Hoo?"" is hands down the standout. The song doesn\'t reach the heights of the powerful ""How Far I\'ll Go."" I don\'t think it will become as well-known as that song, but I enjoyed it.\n\nFor the remaining positives, three solid jokes landed here, its mid-credit scene was delightful, and the film is not that long. Sadly, negatives prevail and weigh down the experience - for me, at least.\n\nAlthough the runtime was short, I was bored even more than ""Gladiator II."" Many factors I\'ll mention possibly led to me thinking the movie was tedious, but its pacing left me dissatisfied.\n\nI also felt the villain fell flat, not as much as The Rock\'s other release this month, ""Red One."" I won\'t reveal who it is to avoid spoilers, but I didn\'t feel the threat from the film\'s antagonist.\n\nSo I don\'t over-critique it, I\'ll bring up one more point: I felt the narrative was weak. The setup of Moana going on an adventure to unite the islands seems simple at first, but the overall handling of that story comes across as convoluted. Said convolution leaves me with no investment in potentially emotional moments.\n\nOverall, ""Moana 2"" didn\'t work for me. I don\'t think it was unnecessary, but it didn\'t entirely justify its existence. It\'s simple and inoffensive yet oddly forgettable, so it\'s a fine enough trip to the movies. However, I\'m not recommending this in favor of ""Wicked"" for the Thanksgiving holiday season.\n\nTechnically, outside of issues with the story, the animation remains stunning, the voice acting is stellar, and the music is well-done yet average from my perspective, so the technical score is an 8/10.\n\nFor the enjoyment score, it is a standard sequel that has enjoyment but a standard sequel that is undeniably weaker than its counterpart. For me, the enjoyment score is a 5/10. Again, it is okay and will leave you interested to an extent, but I\'d recommend waiting until Disney+.', ""So going into this movie I was skeptical...very skeptical. I could not find any enjoyment from the first Moana in fact the first Moana unsettled me because the pig scared me tremendously. The story also just wasn't very good and I didn't like the decision to give Dwayne the Rock Johnson hair. The first Moana was Disney's test to see how much unsettling things we could handle and well I guess people handled it well enough to make a part 2.\n\nSo now that I lost my family due to Arcane League of Legends I had no nobody to have Thanksgiving with so instead I watched this. THIS IS A MASTER PIECE STRAIGHT FROM THE ARTISTIC MIND OF LANA LEDOUX MILLER. In fact while watching this movie I felt threatened that it was going to take the place of Morbius as my Morbest movie. In fact it got so close to taking its place I had to think over my life decisions to prepare for a new Morbest movie.\n\nI realized I made a lot of bad decisions in my life like how Vietnam tore me apart. I can proudly say though that this movie is my third Morbest movie. My second place Morbest movie has gyatt to be The Marvels (Go check out all my reviews so everything can make more sense)\n\nNOW I HEAR YOU ASKING WHY IS MOANA 2 SO GOOD.\n\nIT'S SIMPLY MORBTASTIC."", 'Moana 2 takes us back to the ocean and gives us another exciting chapter in her journey. The visuals are stunning, the story is okay solid (U\'LL LOVED THE LAST 20 MINUTES), and there are plenty of fun, heartwarming moments. But let\'s be honest-the music just doesn\'t hit the same way it did in the first movie.\n\nIn the original Moana, Lin gave us absolute bangers like ""Where You Are"" and ""You\'re Welcome."" Those songs weren\'t just good-they were unforgettable. They added so much life to the movie and stuck in your head (in the best way). But in Moana 2, the songs feel... fine? They\'re okay, but there\'s no wow factor, no song that makes you want to immediately add it to your playlist (except for Beyond 😉).\n\nStill, it\'s hard not to miss the kind of music that made the first Moana so special. If you\'re a fan of the first movie, you\'ll probably enjoy this one too, but you might find yourself wishing for just one more Lin-Manuel masterpiece to hum along to.', 'It doesn\'t match the original story wise, but the animation is superb and there are definitely a few great emotional moments that make it at least worth a watch. Songs are not as catchy As the first one. A lot of things weren\'t clear. Moana a demi god now? What happened to the bat lady who was trapped? So many questions.\n\nSynopsis: Walt Disney Animation Studios\' epic animated musical ""Moana 2"" takes audiences on an expansive new voyage with Moana, Maui and a brand-new crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she\'s ever faced.', ""Moana 2 is an enjoyable sequel that I saw with my 4 and 8 year old daughters. I would recommend it for anyone with children as they are likely to be held for the duration and enjoy it.\n\nThe plot contains a lot of the same formula from the original movie (and Disney Princess animated features in general). This is not an issue, but for me what slightly disappoints is feeling shortchanged on story for what feels like the setting up of a third movie. On reflection (at the end) it feels like the slower character focussed aspects of the pre-adventure scenes (although good) are making up for the lack of material during the adventure. Compared to the original where the main antagonist had a fully realised character arc with a great twist, this one makes no contribution other than to pitch the next instalment. (There is a mid-credits scene so don't leave the cinema too early)\n\nThat being said there are no weak sequences, spectacle or character moments. I like how all the characters are used, particularly Moana's sweet little sister and all the relationships portrayed between people. The underlying message of togetherness and connecting people is very worthwhile. The new slant on the Kakamora is great.\n\nAs for the songs, I think, as always, it is a matter of taste, but for me they are not as memorable as the original.\n\nAs always with Disney the animation is incredible and the voice performances are great."", ""Compared to the first film, I would say it falls short, it is very difficult to surpass the standards that were set with the first release. The film was very enjoyable, there are 1 or 2 songs that were really good and the plot follows very well the narrative line that was proposed to us at the end of the previous film. I really appreciate that it paved the way for a sequel. Dspite that, it feels like the plot, especially at the beginning of the movie, was forced to pave the way for what would happen, making it very predictable, therefore it was difficult to get emotional. Personally, I think the film deserved a little more time to study the script and the characters. Many things feel out of place. Even though it has its small flaws, the movie is really good, the graphics are beautiful, the audiovisual effects give you goosebumps and you really get fond of the protagonist. Therefore I highly recommend watching this movie and make sure to watch it with headphones if you're going to do it at home, because it will greatly improve the experience. I will be waiting for a new release, as long as they take their due time to make the sequel since it is preferable to wait for the Moana 3 experience to be the best they could have done."", 'Let\'s face it. The first Moana was amazing. Great soundtrack, great characters, great character arcs, and it was fun for the whole family. It was one of those movies that didn\'t need a sequel, because it was just perfect.\n\nUnfortunately, I can\'t say the same about its follow-up.\n\nMoana 2 felt soulless. It felt as if there was no heart behind it, unlike its predecessor. Each song that was sung (except for 1 or 2) wasn\'t that great. They weren\'t catchy, and didn\'t make me excited for what was about to happen!\n\nAnd the side characters...where do I begin?\n\nI couldn\'t tell you their names, even if I tried. They felt unnecessary throughout the movie except in very few scenes. It was just all so forced. We\'re given basic information about them and that\'s it. They don\'t really have any character development, and if they do, I don\'t feel like I know them well enough to care.\n\nThere are also some plot holes. There is a scene (and to avoid spoilers I will be as vague as possible) where we\'re introduced to a character who has been trapped by the ""villain"" of the film. (Why I have quotes around villain, I\'ll get back to later on.) After her 5 minute introduction, she is left behind and we never find out what happens to her, even after the defeat of the villain.\n\nTo get to my point on the villain, he was barely introduced. All we get told as an audience is that he\'s a power hungry god and that\'s it. We get barely any exposition, and the final battle is so fast. It felt like so much build up for nothing.\n\nNot a lot felt like it changed for Moana and her character by the end of the film. The stakes just barely felt like they were there.\n\nWhich also reminds me, the pacing for the movie was very off. Some scenes felt so fast while others took their time, and it gave me a weird feeling of not caring as much as the first film, although I wanted to care.\n\nAll in all, it\'s not the worst film ever. It\'s a family flick, that your kids will probably enjoy, but for me personally, it\'s definitely not one that I\'d watch more than once.', ""Yes it was fast pased, yes there was not much character development, but my children loved every minute of it. I personally really liked the music. I am still humming some of the songs like Beyond, and my daughter was doing chee hoos in the car ride back home. The singing of Auli i Cravalho was incredible, I did not like the singing of the Rock that much, but that's ok.\n\nIt was a visual and musically great experience. Disney did not dissapoint me or my childeren and that is what it is all about. So dont mind al'l the saurkraut eters that say it is not as good as the first movie, just go and enjoy it for what it is!"", ""Nothing exciting here to see. I went with a pack of kids and teens. They all said it was kind of boring and not as good as the first. I had to agree. Floppy plot. A randomly weird new character gives her terrible life advice that steers her to make irrational choices that bring her success. The voices were good but the songs didn't wow. They were definitely not as good as the original soundtrack of Moana; felt more pop in style with less local color. The songs weren't memorable. We all kind of groaned when they sang again.\n\nSome cute and funny moments. The kids laughed a couple times. The other feelings felt manufactured- like they were trying really hard to evoke emotions in the audience rather than just letting people feel in response to the story itself.\n\nMoana is kind of a narcissist's love song and the other characters don't get filled out much. She saves the day all the time and has all the ideas, skills, enthusiasm, gumption, and smartness, whereas everyone else just muddles around not being as brave, smart, capable or bold. She talked about teamwork but it seemed like the other characters (other than Maui) were just foils. Moana was kind of annoying and Maui wasn't as well-developed this time around. The villains don't get much development either. The plot is kind of disjointed and meanders; I can see how this was originally conceived as a Disney+ series. Nice animation though, neat textiles; the animation of the woven sails and her hair were well done. Some fuzzy feeling family hugs; it was nice to see a whole family portrayed positively in a Disney movie. It wasn't awful, it just was a little flat despite the feeling that they were trying very hard. Maybe it felt a bit like a commercial for a new round of toys."", ""Giving this an 8/10 rating\n\nNot as good as the first film, but still, it has magic and adventure and lots of fun, and the animation is just wonderful. The firm is set well after the events that have changed Moana's destiny in the last film, and leads firmly into where she and here people must go next.\n\nThankfully, even with a nice runtime, this is not rushed, the new cast gets used good and proper, the songs are snappy and fit well, and yes Dwayne Johnson does sing too, and has settled int well for voice work so expect more. Good that Aull'i Carvalho is back as Moana, and really runs with it.\n\nYou have three writers and directors working on this, sounds chaotic, but it works out just fine, and does not feel episodic, the ocean and sea life is never dull looking, and the whole soundtrack fits in and not in the way as are the songs, this is a very good sequel, even if I didn't want one, the story has plenty of room. Just have to wait and see how this performs in the coming weeks of December, now.\n\nA great animated Disney film that has noting political or stupid messaging in it, pure entertainment and a one for IMAX if you can catch it there. Happy to see this picture in the cinema."", ""Visually, the movie was super beautiful with stunning animations to rival the previous movie. There are lots of funny call backs, and fun new characters, but the story is very formulaic. It's the same movie again with more bells and whistles and worse music. The music is a major let down. The fact they didn't have Lin Manuel Miranda really showed in the music. You're welcome was written perfectly for Dwayne Johnson but this time around, his lack of singing skills really show.\n\nI think kids will love this movie, with the cute characters and fun call backs. All the new characters open up more merchandising opportunities of course.\n\nFrozen 1 and 2 were so uniquely different yet such strong movies all around, but I find Moana 2 is just a repeat of the same story. I had higher hopes!"", ""GenX reporting in. My 12 year old really wanted to see this one. I liked it more than he did. I was not expecting this level of creative 3D animation! The water comes up in the beach and it looks real. The expresions on the characters faces are off the charts well done. Easy to watch action that was clear. The creature designs were highly creative and super funny. What else do you want in a cartoon? The style and perspectives were very well done. There was only a few songs so that was good for me. This film does get a bit dark towards the end, but doesn't every Disney film get dark at some point? I may go see it again before the end of it's run. 8/10."", ""I didn't think it was possible for the sequel to be better than the original, but I was just proved wrong. Amazing movie for families and I highly recommend this to watch. The cast is the exact same, except for some new characters, which makes it a great movie and allows it to have some similar aspects to the original. The songs are also very well written and I really like them. They almost match up to the original movie's songs. One thing to note for young kids is that number 2 is a bit scarier than number 1, so just make sure that they'll be okay watching this one even if they've already seen #1."", 'This movie was pretty bad. I was bored from start to finish. It felt like somebody wanted to make a sequel but wasn\'t clever enough to come up with one so they decided to remake the first one only worse. Adding more characters and braindead animals doesn\'t make it different or better. The story made no sense this time around, there wasn\'t really a villain and the purpose of the journey wasn\'t exactly clear. Overall, very weak and convoluted story with terrible songs, terrible writing, boring characters, unfunny humor and dull. The visuals were geat though. Except for Maui. It seems unnecessary to make him as ugly as they do. It\'s pretty excessive. It\'s like they were designing the character and somebody kept barging in and saying ""nope, not ugly enough. Keep trying"".', ""Moana 2 is everything a sequel should be-visually stunning, emotionally captivating, and filled with heart. The animation is absolutely breathtaking, with vibrant colors and incredible attention to detail that bring the ocean and islands to life.\n\nThe story delivers a beautiful balance of adventure, humor, and heartfelt moments, making it a memorable journey for audiences of all ages. I found myself laughing at Hei Hei's hilarious antics and melting over Pua's adorable moments. Moana's personal growth and the introduction of new characters added even more magic to the already beloved world.\n\nThe songs, while not as iconic as the original, are still powerful and beautifully woven into the narrative. 🎶 The themes of courage, self-discovery, and connection are inspiring and left me feeling uplifted and in awe.\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece and a must-see for Disney fans and anyone who loves an emotional and visually stunning journey. I'd give it a solid 10/10!"", ""Movie was good, don't get me wrong. But there are two new characters that get almost zero screen time who would have made the movie a lot more exciting. Mantagi and Nalo. Mantagi sings a good song with Moana and that's all you really see of her, and the villain Nalo is not even seen until after the credits, I would have liked to see more of these two. Mauis song is great, beyond is cute too, just felt more like a long prequel to Moana 3 which will be great but I also don't want to wait forever for like we did with this one....curious if this is how everyone is feeling or just me. Still enjoyed tho!"", ""This movie was super cute just like the first it is interesting has a lot of comical moments and the mythology and story as it correlates to the mariners and their island life and how Moana's character arc grows as well as Maui's is really a great family film that I thoroughly enjoyed watching with my brothers and my son today as a Thanksgiving Memory together. It suits well as a follow-up sequel and the movie is super cute sweet and Adorable. I really liked the fact that they expanded the seafaring adventures for moana to include a full crew as opposed to her venturing out on her own with hey hey and maui as her only companions I found the movie to be thoroughly enjoyable and I think that most audiences and families will as well."", ""The film works for children, just like its predecessor, but it leaves little to be remembered, unlike the first one.\n\nThe original Moana was a visual result that oscillated between the beautiful and the sublime.\n\nFrom the beauty of the crystal clear ocean to the green colors of the island, the beauty of the universe was seen in a duel with the equally beautiful and captivating protagonist and due to the feeling of weight we feel on screen, the entire world-building of the film perfected the journey and gave it a proven strong iconography, with memorable music and perhaps the best performance of The Rock's career.\n\nThe original Moana captured a cultural element that for a long time was seen as taboo, such as tattoos, and made it central to its story with beautiful arguments and gave its film a purpose and respect for the minds of children, teenagers and adults, with other viable messages for everyone.\n\nThis movie doesn't have that. At least not to the same extent.\n\nMoana 2 is similar to a walk in the park to distract the little ones while the parents have some peace.\n\nThis walk certainly shouldn't be a waste of time for them and probably not for the parents either, since there is enough movement, color, humor and music to disguise the lack of ideas.\n\nThe film is concerned with following the model of contemporary animations in the speed and volume of jokes, action scenes and use of music inserted into the story in exchange for capturing your attention, instead of winning it over with a good narrative.\n\nThe absence of Clements and Musker is palpable. It's ok, but not memorable."", ""Moana 2 argues that she has to stop playing it safe and go off the beaten track only to then do the exact opposite as it copies the plot of the original just with greater scale and weaker everything else. Its origins as a TV show are definitely felt in the very choppy first act where no scene is allowed to last but it thankfully finds a better rhythm afterwards as it actually begins to feel like a film and then comes together nicely in the third act.\n\nAuli'i Cravalho gives it her all as Moana again, bringing as much emotion as possible to her new songs and every scene with Khaleesi Lambert-Tsud as her adorable younger sister is heartwarming to counterbalance the fact her journey is so much weaker here. Her new crew are mildly annoying even if they all find their purpose by the end and it needed way more of Awhimai Fraser. Dwayne Johnson is still charming as Maui but all the flaws and vulnerability have sadly gone.\n\nAfter the shaky start, directors David G. Derrick Jr., Jason Hand, and Dana Ledoux Miller make sure the film feels epic enough to warrant a cinematic release and the visuals during the musical numbers are suitably inventive. The animation is the one aspect that comes close to the original thanks to its stunning detail and vibrancy from beginning to end. The new songs don't come close to the quality of their predecessors and the score is only memorable when reusing previous work."", 'I am very attached to the first Moana, and it\'s always a film that I come back to when I need a mood lift or something to distract me from the problems of the world for an hour and a half, so hearing about the sequel got me both excited and nervous, as the first is really important to me.\n\nFirstly, just to clarify, it is really good and I did thoroughly enjoy the movie, and I do see myself watching it again.\n\nSo, starting with the bad, I have a bit of a bone to pick with Matangi, she is the weirdest and most unnecessary part of the film, I really wanted her to have a villain arc, and she really seemed perfect to have some sort of an evil plan or sudden shift in mind, which really would have been so good and would have drastically improved the main conflict of the story, instead I\'ll just call her ""a potential gone to waste"", she was on the screen for a couple of minutes, than she was gone and no one remembered she was there. She also had the only song that had zero Polynesian influence, which was a bit awkward compared to the rest of the movie.\n\nSecondly, the main conflict didn\'t seem to have enough tension, or not as much as it should have had (although the part right after it was an improvement) if the god would have gone down from the sky to fight them or at least made things a little harder than the tension would have been felt so much more, but it was still tense, just could have been a little tenser.\n\nThirdly, the writing got a little weird and too ""zoomer coded"" at some parts, and would have loved it more if they were just a bit more raw rather than sounding like 2014 born children at a couple of parts (although the writing was also wonderful at some others and I laughed on so many occasions)\n\nLastly, the ending was a bit rushed, with all of the other sailors arriving to the island, as much as it made sense, could have been a more gradual process and I would have loved it way more.\n\nNow onto the good (don\'t worry there\'s a lot of good)\n\nFirstly, the Polynesian theme sticks hard and I love it, it really feels like they are trying to be traditional with their music and the theme and I\'m living for it, especially because it is such an unrepresented culture worldwide and Moana really helps shine a light on the Polynesians.\n\nSecondly, the visuals are amazing, and the movie itself is gorgeous, the animators have really worked hard on it and I can only applaud them for the visual masterpiece.\n\nThirdly, the songs are still great, and I really enjoy their Polynesian theme, it was one of my favorite parts about the first and it really is no different, still absolutely beautiful.\n\nIn addition. I did criticize the writing a bit, but I can\'t deny that they still did a really good job overall, and there were so many genius moments and funny jokes and I am ready to forgive their sins because the screenwriters really did a good job in the end, also, the new characters traveling with Moana were very fun and it felt like each one of them has had a moment and they still felt like an integral part of the film, which is good because characters like this tend to feel a little awkward and useless at some points.\n\nOverall, I had a good time, and I would like to go watch it again and see if there are a couple of things that I didn\'t catch last time (I\'d like to think Matangi has a meaning and I just didn\'t understand it). And I\'m pretty sure the ending did try to set up a third movie (and also the mid credits scene foreshadowed a little) so we\'ll see, but yeah, I think it really deserves a watch, but go form your own opinion :)', ""Saw this with my nephew today--we're each a fan of the first one for different reasons--and both of us were whelmed. It feels like they didn't push or take any creative risks with this one. Flows like a recycled, watered-down attempt to replicate what the first movie captured so effortlessly. The emotional core is painfully missing with this one. None of the musical numbers have you at the edge of your seat like How Far I'll Go, or choking up like the Song of the Ancestors. It's beautiful enough to look at, but without a good story to ground it, it makes sense that the characters, the music and the overall experience falter. It was still as good a time as many animated films I've seen, don't get me wrong, but it pales in comparison to its predecessor."", 'We loved the first Moana but this was just didn\'t pull us in, the songs weren\'t catchy, a bunch a jokes that didn\'t make sense, accents that didn\'t make sense, everything wrapped up in the last 10-15 minutes to make it seem like the movie was good when in reality it most mostly just filler material. Our kids had a good time so that\'s all that matters, but they\'re pretty easy to please, bright colors and silly animals is about all it takes. Also there was a scene with a new ""villain"" that didn\'t get resolved, just sorta moved on to the next big ""conflict"" of the movie. They brought back a couple of the old songs which was nice. I don\'t need to see this one again, the original will always be a favorite, maybe the third one will be better but I doubt it.', ""I'm surprised at the negative reviews here and around the 'net. For context, I rewatched the original a few days ago, in anticipation of seeing the sequel, so both are very fresh in my mind. If you haven't seen the original for a while, I honestly can't see that as anything but a plus.\n\nThis movie builds on the mythology and world of the first. Moana, now a celebrated wayfinder, is tasked with finding a specific island for the sake of her people. She recruits some new (very fun) characters, but some old friends return too. (And yes, I am the sort of simple person who laughs every time Heihei does something)\n\nI particularly liked how the characters have aged since the first movie (Moana's parents have grey hairs and crow's feet). And while there are numerous callbacks to jokes from the original, it doesn't feel like too much.\n\nOn to the important part: the songs! I personally judge musicals by the amount of songs I want to rewatch/rehear as soon as the credits roll. In this film I counted three original songs (not to mention the gorgeous incidental music and callbacks) that I could play on repeat. Which is pretty good for a new Disney movie, in my case.\n\nTL;DR: It's a sequel that doesn't feel unnatural or unwarranted. Some great songs, some new characters to love. Give it a try."", 'Just saw ""Moana 2"", the sequel to the 2016 Disney animated film ""Moana"". Once again featuring the voices of Auli\'i Cravalho and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, it is a subpar follow-up that delivers visually but not narratively.\n\nThree years after the events of the first film, Moana (voiced by Auli\'i Cravalho) happily spends her time visiting neighbouring islands hoping to find others who share her ability to connect to the ocean, but to no avail. One day, Moana receives an unexpected vision from her ancestors where she learns that the reason no one connects to the ocean anymore is due to the storm God Nalo sinking the island Motufetu responsible for linking all of the islands together. In an effort to reconnect the ocean with mortal beings, Moana assembles a crew of her people to assist her on a journey to locate and raise the sunken Motufetu to the surface. Meanwhile, the demigod Maui (voiced by Dwayne Johnson) is on his own separate mission to find Motufetu because of his personal history with Nalo, but soon ends up captured and held prisoner deep inside Nalo\'s underwater lair.\n\nJoining Disney\'s official line of Princesses back in 2016 was the strong-willed Polynesian Moana of Motunui. Brought to life by the refreshing vocals of then-newcomer Auli\'i Cravalho, Moana\'s heroism and relatability has since seen her worthily earn a coveted place among the iconic canon of Disney Princesses. However, Moana\'s adventure towards greatness could not have been accomplished without the help of Maui, the tattooed demigod whose shapeshifting abilities complimented the titular hero\'s journey on both the humorous and informative front. The enjoyable pairing up of these two allowed things to conclude on a satisfying note, but since Disney values dollar signs over leaving well enough alone, a sequel was naturally green-lit to continue the story whether audiences wanted it to or not. Now in ""Moana 2"", we are treated to a nicely animated yet rather uninspired follow-up that does little to stir up the same level of excitement as the original.\n\nThe film\'s biggest problem, in my eyes, is that it never fully invests the audience in its surprisingly flat story. As three years have since past, we see that Moana has now embraced her title as chiefess, exploring different islands, albeit, without Maui\'s help. She has grown since her last adventure, but never so much that she forgets how to be compassionate towards all living things. Soon enough, Moana learns that her island home is in danger of becoming fully isolated from all the others unless the missing link island Motufetu is brought back to the surface. For no other reason than to set the plot in motion, Moana goes off on yet another journey to save her people from disappearing forever, at least that\'s what I assume the story was about. Unlike the first film, which was able to captivate the viewer with an intriguing look at Polynesian culture, this one\'s contrived plot device of a sunken island feels more like an afterthought as opposed to a legitimate way to invoke a sense of adventure. Because of this, most of the magic has been lost in the creative process.\n\nAdditionally, with the introduction of a new batch of characters, the film doesn\'t properly develop them beyond either convenient helpers or a cheap punchline. For instance, one of Moana\'s crew members Moni (voiced by Hualalai Chung) is shown to be a devoted fan of Maui, constantly gushing over how amazing and powerful he is. Most of the time, Moni\'s sole purpose is simply to remark how much he wishes Maui was part of the crew, usually resulting in repetitive visual gags that only hamper the flow of the story. Similarly, another crew member Keke (voiced by David Fane) is a grumpy farmer who frequently bickers and complains about everything that happens on their trip. What could have been someone amusing that reluctant older audiences can relate to is instead a bland, one-joke character who failed to raise even the slightest smile out of me. As much as I tried, I just could not find any interesting supporting characters that are able stand out significantly alongside Moana herself, leaving her as the only person in the entire movie with anything worth watching.\n\nWorse still, the dynamic between the title character and the loveable demigod Maui is decidedly lacking. This can be chalked up to the fact that the two hardly interact with each other until about halfway through the movie. One of my favourite things about the original film was watching Moana and Maui learn to work together as a team. Their relationship was hostile at first, but over the course of the story it blossomed into a genuine friendship between these two unlikely heroes. For some reason, the writers of this film have decided to split them up since the events of last time, with Maui off doing his own thing completely independent from Moana. Most of the time, Maui is reduced to being an obligatory prisoner character with little else to do but make weak jokes that often miss the mark. When the time comes for him to be rescued by Moana, his shapeshifting powers frequently malfunction, rendering him fairly useless until the climax of the film.\n\nFortunately, not everything in this movie is a complete failure. Like with the original, the visuals and animation are quite impressive at most times. I actually really liked this one shot near the beginning of Moana looking out over the ocean and using her hand to help navigate the position of the stars. This can be interpreted as showing how much Moana has grown in terms of intellect, utilising her attuned nautical knowledge to size up a situation wherever necessary. Also, even though they aren\'t as memorable as before, the musical numbers help move the film along at a reasonable pace to prevent too much drag. It\'s just a shame that there aren\'t any major songs that leave a lasting impression, except for maybe ""Beyond"", which stands out primarily due to Auli\'i Cravalho\'s passionate vocals rather than the content of the lyrics themselves.\n\nIf I had to single out just one consistently great thing in both the original film and this sequel, it would be Auli\'i Cravalho\'s voice performance in the lead role. Though not much has changed from last time, there\'s just something instantly watchable about the way Cravalho brings to life Disney\'s first Polynesian princess, embodying all of her courageousness and humility to a tee. It\'s actually refreshing to see a female lead in a Disney film who isn\'t afraid to work in harmony with others as opposed to wanting to do everything all by herself to prove that she doesn\'t need any outside help. Even during the film\'s weakest moments, it\'s near impossible not to care about what will happen to Moana due to the sheer amount of personality Cravalho is able to draw out from the character, something highly important when portraying a member of Disney royalty.\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said for Dwayne Johnson as Maui, who isn\'t used as well in this outing as he was previously. While Johnson does his best to contribute some comic relief, it just feels like the writers didn\'t know what to do with his character this time around to make him seem any different from how he was in the original. The only thing that comes to mind is the reason why he wants to raise the sunken island all by himself without Moana\'s help, and that is because he wants to shield her from danger. Apart from that, if it weren\'t for the fact that he was so prominent in the first film, it\'s quite easy to forget his presence in this follow-up.\n\nThough not without its fleeting moments of fun, ""Moana 2"" ultimately proves to be an unnecessary sequel that adds barely anything notable to the expansive lore laid out in its predecessor. Unless you\'re a hardcore fan of the original film, there isn\'t any real reason to go out and watch it on the big screen, though it may be worth checking out on Disney+ if you are curious enough. Up next for the series is a live-action remake of the first film, and judging by the quality of Disney\'s recent efforts, it\'s probably nothing to get excited about. With that in mind, it\'s not like Disney has many new things to offer us anyway, so you can either take these films for what they are or leave them. Personally, I think we should leave them.\n\nI rate it 6/10.', ""So I took my kiddos to see Moana 2 today and it's a very middle of the road film. There wasn't any character development in this movie , it's really just a buckle up and go film. It was likely a tossed together movie to try and get a film out by Disney by Thanksgiving.\n\nWith that being said, I don't think this film is memorable but my kids did enjoy it . There was some adult humor tossed in these that was legitimately funny and made me chuckle. One thing that I did appreciate with this film is that there was no propaganda tossed into this film . This film was short, sweet, and pretty much to the point. It's not a long film so it was nice if you want to factor that in."", ""I watched it, it's a great family movie! The laughter points are very dense! I haven't seen such an animated movie in a long time! An excellent sequel movie with exquisite visuals! Very good-looking! It has a very Disney animation style and beautiful scenes! Although the story is a bit clich é d and even a bit too thin, it doesn't prevent it from being a great animation work. I really like the form of musical films and the music is very good! But it doesn't feel like it's as good as the music in the first installment. The characters in the movie are well drawn and the descriptions are very delicate (I really like Coconut Monster! It's so cute!), but the villain is still as weak as the previous installment... The visual effects are very good, pleasing to the eye, and the color matching is also very beautiful. The visuals are worth watching, but the story pace is average, the foreshadowing is too long, and the overall story doesn't have much plot. However, as a family movie, it's already enough, and watching it on weekends is still very relaxing. It's worth watching."", ""Sequels rarely live up to the originals. This movie was fun, funny and pretty to watch. Once you stop comparing it to the original and just enjoy it as its own thing, you can see that it's actually a pretty good movie. I laughed more than I expected to. No it didn't have nearly the depth of the first one, but again sequels rarely do because all the newness has worn off and you're now in a familiar world, where it's harder to be as enchanted. Originals have the luxury of introducing an audience to something for the first time, which always lends itself to a superior story experience. Come to this just looking to be with a familiar cast and a similar vibe and just enjoy it."", ""Moana (2016) is one of the best Disney Animated movies of the 2010s and that means it gets a sequel even though there's no reason for this to happen, but that isn't going to stop Disney from giving this movie a sequel. Anyways, I just finished watching Moana 2 (2024) and it was decent.\n\nPositives for Moana 2 (2024): The animation looks just as good in this movie as it did in the original. Auli'i Cravalho is still great as Moana and she continues to be the heart and soul of these movies. I enjoyed seeing her teaming p with other people from her tribes on this adventure. The Rock is still just The Rock and he does great in that role. And finally, you get some more great action sequences in this movie.\n\nNegatives or Moana 2 (2024): The musical numbers aren't as good or catchy as they were in the original. The story isn't as interesting as the one from the original. And finally, a lot of the new characters aren't developed enough to get me to care about them.\n\nOverall, Moana 2 (2024) is a decent enough sequel to the original, but it is also a sequel that shouldn't exist."", 'Okay, I\'ll cut to the chase. I wasn\'t very big on ""Moana"" as while I loved its colorful animation and finding the concept to be pretty good, I found myself feeling disconnected with its themes and found the characters to be uninteresting to connect with. With this sequel, while its colorful animation remains high and there are some new concepts that I do appreciate (like exploring some different cultural aspects within the world of Moana) I found myself having the same problems as the first one.\n\nFor starters, Disney once again provides wonderful character designs, sound designs, colors, and animation models as there are some gorgeous background colors. Many of the voice performances are solid with their emotions and personalities expressed. Regarding its writing, there are some new concepts I do appreciate and thought were pretty good, but unfortunately, it ends up being too simple that it ends feeling too safe and engaging to fully sink into the world of Moana.\n\nI never really connected with the characters. Don\'t get me wrong, the character of Moana is definitely a good inspiration for children and I understand the creator\'s intentions and their goals, however, I found most of the characters to be uninteresting or pretty annoying, particularly the character of Maui who I can\'t really stand. The writing is bland as certain concepts could have been explored a bit differently but failed. As a musical, most of the music writing and singing are surprisingly pretty bad. Many of the music notes and the lyrics are pretty bad and none of the music, unlike the first one, had much memorable scores.\n\nOverall, Disney sequels are rarely done well as they never really seemed to re-capture the essence of what made the first one good. As much as Disney is showing some improvements within this year, I found myself feeling that the real magic of Disney is pretty much faded.', ""This movie was a 10/10, I recommend to watch it. Me and my family went to theaters to watch it, and it was one of the best movies we've seen so far. But let's be honest, the first movie was better. But still, me and my family enjoyed watching this masterpiece. After 8 years, I was so excited to watch this extraordinary movie. Heihei is funny, he doesn't miss at making me laugh every time.\n\nThank you so much for this amazing movie, I know this is just a film but it still taught me some things that I will never forget.

It was the first thing my eight year old said to me when we walked out, the music was nowhere near as good. The funny part about the music is, the music that was reprised from the first one managed to succeed in helping upgrade the score.

I think that if there is a part 3 that will close the series, it will be a good move and we should end this adventure."", ""I saw Moana 2 on November 28, 2024 at LexLive in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nFor being a sequel to a classic movie, Moana 2 is pretty good. The voice acting is great, the story is entertaining, and sometimes it's fairly funny. But it definitely fell short of the expectations I had for it. The first film, Moana (2016), was clever and funny and had an emotional and interesting story. Moana 2's story, while entertaining, was paper thin and missing some key elements. Moana 2 tries to be as emotional as the first, but sometimes feels as if it's telling the audience to laugh or cry instead of letting them feel their own emotions.\n\nMoana 2 is not bad. I laughed a couple times and I enjoyed the film. It is aimed at a younger audience than the original film, but that's expected. If you're looking for a fun new movie to go see, and you were a fan of the first one, go and check Moana 2 out.\n\n7/10.\n\n-Steele Wyndham."", ""Watched the movie in the first day of theatrical release.

Sucks balls that the fight scenes in this movie isn't as good as the first film's. The villains in Moana 2 are not as good as in the first film.\n\nThe film was boring at first but it gets slightly better as the film goes on.

The songs in the first are second to none, perhaps that's where Moana 2 may be failing, but sometimes you need to warm up to music.\n\nFor me, Moana 2 was a masterpiece, a true coming together, feel good, make you cry film. It's downfall maybe? Comparison."", 'Moana 2, the sequel to the beloved 2016 Disney movie Moana, is among us. Considering its Production history and how it was reworked from a Disney+ steaming series to a theatrical feature film, I have quite a lot to say about this movie.\n\nStarting with the visuals. They look stunning. The vibrant colors, the gorgeous landscapes, the lightening, and the water effects, it all looks incredibly beautiful especially on the Big Screen. The voice performances are solidly delivered particularly by Auli\'i Cravalho as Moana once again. Dwanye Johnson as Maui is still epic as ever. The banter between our two leads is infectious and the movie is at its best when they are together. Out of the new characters, Moana\'s little sister Simea is the standout. She is incredibly adorable and provides an emotional core of the movie as Moana is not ready to leave her. And that mid-credits scene was pretty great which has me excited about the future of this franchise.\n\nNow speaking of the story, well it\'s just a repeat of the first movie. This results in the story feeling uninspired and predictable. The pacing feels clunky. The movie starts off with a rushed first act but then heavily slows down during the second act. That said, the third act was pretty strong and it neatly ties the movie together. Another issue is that the music is nowhere near as memorable as the original. It\'s not bad by any means, there are some songs that are infact pretty good and are catchy enough like ""Beyond"" and ""Get Lost"" but not on the same level as ""How Far I\'ll Go"" or ""You\'re Welcome"". Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear are clearly talented songwriters however one cannot help but feel the absence of Lin Manuel Miranda. Moana also has a new crew this time but all the three new characters- Moni, Loto and Kele, feel very much underdeveloped. And the character of Matangi feels like such a wasted potential in terms of being a great villain.\n\nDespite the many criticisms I\'ve had of this movie, I did enjoy myself. The families in my theatre clearly had a good time as most of them clapped at the end and especially the little kids who had a lot of fun with it.\n\nOverall, Moana 2 may lack the narrative and musical brilliance of it\'s predecessor, but still delights as a colorful adventure boasting eye-popping visuals, charming performances and a mid-credits scene that is worth the wait.', ""This sequel was very disappointing because of bland and poorly written. But that's not The disappointing part, what's sad is that Disney decided to make this into a movie when it was originally going to be a short tv show on Disney plus however since they've lost money they needed an instant cash grab. They hired cheaper animators and didn't get the original song writer or directors of the first movie. It is not the worst but definitely felt like a direct to dvd sequel.

I think it is a rare sequel that can grab you like the first if the first was truly special or unique, so I don't think a viewer should go in with that expectation.

This movie felt like they just threw darts on a wall for ideas and animated it.\n\nAbout 40 minutes of this movie virtually nothing happens and then finally the story actually begins.

However, that safety does not allow the story and this sequel to go a step further to try to innovate in new attractions, although it has a fresh and emotional story to its credit, it also suffers from a couple of gaps in the journey towards its outcome, which takes away from the intentions of a sequel that is charming in any case.\n\nThe familiar characters continue to give us fun moments, Moana is still a great Disney character, and the studio continues to outdo itself with brutal, sensational and masterful animation, full of colors, textures and lights that visually make Moana 2 a step further in subtlety. As for the music and its songs, perhaps it is quite lacking, but a couple of songs do their job, although not enough to stand out categorically.\n\nIn short, it is a family adventure film full of excitement and visual wonders that focuses on the youngest members of the family. A nice message runs through its veins with a plot that is more complex and dark, but that has a current and pertinent message, which makes Moana 2 a fulfilling and correct film that will leave the vast majority happy and others somewhat less motivated, but in no case offended or upset because the film has a formula that will leave everyone included because it is a proposal that will not offend anyone, rather it will involve everyone.', ""I am generally not here rating movies but i think this one i should talk about a little.\n\nThe pace of the movie seemed rushed.

We wanted to he immersed first into the world of Moana (so much lost opportunity). Such a beautiful culture yet they settled for magic and all the alien creatures, i feel it was really not necessary for the plot line. There needed to be more character development. Maybe finding one's new identity inside of it being yet another adventure, lets try to surpass the past one. There was no need for that and no one asked for it.

However, I\'m not a fan of the team-up or Matangi\'s sequence: the former because it\'s just lazy Disney writing and the latter because it\'s slightly aimless, as even the narrative forgot about her at the end of the film. While the entirely of the side quests and level-ups in the first film lead up to the characters\' being prepared skill-wise and mentally against Te Fiti, there\'s just a lack of connection among the individual plotlines in Moana 2 especially when it comes to Nalo.

Nice voice acting, brilliant animation, and humor that was alright. And yes, Moana 2 had its moments where I actually enjoyed the film. Definitely an entertaining one for the little kids. But there were a lot of things missing from this; the plot wasn't as complex as the others and quite flat, and had a ton of holes, and new characters that barely added to the plot were added who were extremely generic and basically the comic relief. The songs were somewhat lacking originality, or to me, they didn't stand out that much against other musical numbers in the other new mediocre Disney films. The villain was barely in the movie and the stakes were so much less high than in the first. And overall, it was just a lot cheesier and predictable. Not to mention, there was absolutely no sense of morals or finishing that left me unsatisfied, unlike the first which taught kids good lessons about perseverance, kindness, bravery, etc. Perhaps I am just a big fan of the first; but this did not live up to my expectations. I would rate it lower, but considering this is mostly for kids, it's a six out of ten. Really disappointed with Disney... and the fact there will be a third makes it even worse. I loved the first...but Moana 2 is just mediocre...and that's something I thought I would never say. Disney, stop making unnecessary sequels, please!"", ""The plot and art comes through but the soundtrack falls quite short. The introduction of new characters was smooth. The ending gives a lot of potential for the next movies without it feeling like an annoying cliff hanger.\n\nThe new villain doesn't really have a strong presence in this movie but will likely play a bigger role in future films.\n\nI'm not sure why the music didn't come through, nothing is catchy or immersive. It may be the absence of Lin Manuel Miranda in the musical cast.\n\nThe water continues to have beautiful mechanics, same with details like hair, textures, clothes.\n\nAt least doesn't feel repetitive.""]",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/moana-2/3aa3b120-5c35-48fc-b346-d27fe120bccb.webp

In a well-constructed atmosphere, the viewer enters the past of a country, a past that is disowned and ignored by the country itself, and this makes the experience of watching ""I\'m Still Here"" in a movie theater in Brazil even more powerful. Of all the Brazilian filmmakers, Walter Salles stands out with his talented direction and interesting photography, and the production is truly impressive. The actors are talented and I want to highlight the younger actors, who certainly give the film a touch of depth and beauty necessary for us to feel the ""magic of cinema"". Regarding the kind human side present in ""I\'m Still Here"", it is wonderful to see a film by a filmmaker who truly understands cinema, who does not present alienated ideas but rather pure and genuine human expression. As a Brazilian, of course, I will be rooting for Walter Salles\' work to be nominated for an Oscar, but I think the goal of making national cinema talked about again has already been achieved. Beautiful film, beautiful message and beautiful performances.', ""Brazilian film with the greatest international repercussion in recent years, winner of the best screenplay award at the Venice Film Festival and nominated for an Oscar, I'm Still Here dramatizes the trajectory of the Paiva family between the arrest of Rubens Paiva, the father, and Eunice's struggle after her husband's disappearance. Walter Salles immerses the viewer in the intimacy of this family and makes them an accomplice, making them care about the fate of each one, creating three-dimensional, real, believable characters. Fernanda Torres plays the role of her life, almost a Greek heroine marked by tragedy, with subtlety, without ever falling into excess or caricature. Detailed scenography, lean script, natural interpretations, hand-picked soundtrack, precise editing, everything contributes to the director being able to convey exactly what he set out to do. As I knew the story, I had read the book on which the film is based, in addition to reports about it, my attention focused on the cinematographic solutions used by the director. He manages to turn this particular story into something universal, capable of communicating with audiences anywhere in the world."", 'Adapted from the novel by Marcelo Rubens Paiva, ""I\'m Still Here"" actually improves on the book by focusing on the Paiva family and how every member was startled and heartbroken by the disappearance of their father (played with deep affection by Selton Mello). Anchored by a powerhouse performance by Fernanda Torres as the matriarch Eunice, the film narrates the horrors of the Brazilian dictatorship without ever being preachy or heavy-handed. By focusing on the human aspects and the sense of loss of those people who never got and answer about their loved one\'s disappearance, the script gets more powerful as it goes along. All the performances from the young actors are top-notch - a rare feat in Brazilian cinema - but it is Fernanda Torres incredibly restrained performance that really stays with you. She\'s persuasive and moving without ever being melodramatic, in a masterful work. This is the best Brazilian film in years, a gift from director Walter Salles (""Central Station""). Pay attention to the brief but powerful cameo by Fernanda Montenegro (an Oscar nominee for ""Central Station"") at the very end. ""I\'m Still Here"" is a movie to cherish and to hold.', 'Living in.brazil, but only came to Brazil much later, the film gives a unique insight as to how it was to live during the dictatorship in 70s Brazil. Besides a window into how Rio looked In the 70s, lifestyle etc.\n\nI would love that people who voted in favour of extreme right would see how the dictatorship worked, feel how it impacted people, that were minimally politically involved and persecuted.\n\nThe film is expertly showing that with subtlety like many small papercuts into the soul how easy it was for someone to dissappear, how basic rights were violated.\n\nIt is a highly topical film and very important, highlighting a wound in Brazilian society that has never really healed. And yet, some people wish for these painful times to return. I hope you watch this masterpiece and start reflecting.', 'The greatest strength of Ainda Estou Aqui lies in its use of memory not as a passive recollection of the past but as an act of resistance to preserve the dignity and identity of those who were brutally silenced. Walter Salles, by revealing the faces, names, and humanity of those whose lives were interrupted by the dictatorship, transforms memory into a manifesto for justice.\n\nEarly on, we see Selton Mello in a sensitive and powerful performance, almost like a breath of tenderness before the storm. He brings to life a loving father, a man who soon becomes the epicenter of a pain that seeps into every corner of the house. What was once a bright home, filled with laughter and ordinary days, is now shrouded by drawn curtains, with the constant presence of strangers and the vigilant eyes of military officers. Walter Salles turns the absence of Rubens Paiva into an invisible character, while the family begins to live a routine suffocated by external fear.\n\nAnd it is Fernanda Torres who gives body and soul to this story; she embodies living resistance, something the dictatorship could never take away: the fierce drive of a woman to rebuild what was destroyed, to keep alive the flame of a story that belongs to her. Eunice Paiva, facing the loss of her husband, the invisible violence of silence, the systematic erasure of a life, finds strength in the ruins. Fernanda portrays her as a woman who, in her quiet struggle, refuses to let horror prevail over memory, to let emptiness triumph over love. Eunice Paiva is a character who, at once, moves and unsettles, because as spectators, we remain alert, expecting dramatic outbursts, unrestrained crying, grand gestures that melodrama has accustomed us to seeing - but Eunice\'s pain does not manifest like that. It is there, deeply buried, engraved in her soul, sustained by a quiet strength that will not let it overflow, for the love of her children. It is a pain that exists without fanfare, that corrodes without screaming, and this restraint makes it all the more devastating. The scene in which Fernanda eats ice cream with her daughters, trying to project a happiness that no longer exists, is magnificent.\n\nBy the end of the film, when I was already shattered, the epilogue delivers Fernanda Montenegro. Just the first movement of her eyes, and I was undone. What Montenegro conveys in that moment, without a word, is masterful. She brings to the screen the strength of a woman who refuses to let the past dissipate, who keeps photos, clippings, dates, and notes not just for herself, but to ensure that memory survives any attempt at erasure - even the erosion of her own Alzheimer\'s.\n\nNothing in Ainda Estou Aqui is incidental or superfluous. The 35mm cinematography is delicately ""Walterian,"" poetic yet raw, managing to be aesthetic without stealing the scene. The absence of a dramatic score is a bold and effective choice, trusting the drama already present, which pulses in the pauses, the gazes, and the breaths. The sound design is punctuated by airplanes, gunfire, and the distant rumble of military vehicles, hinting at the constant horror and invisible control imposed by the dictatorship. The editing is precise, respecting the rhythm of grief without rushing, and the screenplay - sensitive and powerful - allows the actors to shine, letting pain and love resonate through dialogues of precise intensity. The production design, meticulous in its detail, splendidly recreates an era without drawing attention to itself.\n\nThere is something in Walter Salles\' cinema that is a rare delicacy in Brazilian filmmaking: the ability to translate emotion and aesthetics into a language that touches us without being obvious or pedantic. Walter finds beauty in the subtleties, in the shadows, and in what is left unsaid. For him, emotion resides in the details, in the silence, in the frames that vibrate without needing words. This is the work of a mature director who knows exactly when to step in and when to let the story speak for itself.\n\nIt is a remarkable film that makes me even prouder of our national cinema. Ainda Estou Aqui is, without a doubt, already a classic of contemporary cinema.', '""I\'m Still Here"" goes beyond being just another film about the military dictatorship, offering a human, intense, and brutally intimate portrait of a family unraveling under overwhelming, uncontrollable forces. Walter Salles, with his raw style and unmatched sensitivity, returns to the theme of a country immersed in repression, but rather than focusing on big political events, he zeroes in on their consequences within homes and personal lives. By centering the story on family drama, Salles subverts the expectation of a traditional historical film, avoiding documentary tones or a broad, structural focus. Here, 1970s Brazil is felt through the struggles of the Paiva family, and in the painful details of their shared wounds, Salles portrays the scars left by a dictatorship that, while distorted in collective memory, remains alive in the lives it shattered.\n\nChoosing to center the narrative through Eunice\'s perspective-played by the iconic Fernanda Torres and Fernanda Montenegro-lends the film an undeniable authenticity. While dealing with the loss of her husband, Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), a public figure and defender of the people\'s rights, Eunice has to keep the family together and maintain her children\'s emotional stability. Eunice is the pure embodiment of resilience and motherly love, and her daily routine, her rituals with her children, and moments shared as a family are slices of a once-ordinary life, now wrecked by an abrupt absence. Family dinners and memories of beach outings become painful when revisited after Rubens\' disappearance, as they reveal the empty space left by systemic violence. Salles skillfully uses this family intimacy to show how dictatorship destroys emotional bonds and disrupts each home\'s peace, prompting audiences to reflect on how history is also shaped by losses and silent moments in everyday life.\n\nFernanda Torres\' performance is intensely deserving of praise. She embodies a woman who refuses to let grief immobilize her, balancing the protection of her children with the relentless search for answers about her husband\'s whereabouts. This balance between strength and vulnerability gives Eunice a striking and essential presence in the film. In a moving and remarkably mature performance, Montenegro, as the older Eunice, intensifies the impact of Rubens\' absence, bringing a heavy, almost physical silence that resonates in those who never got the chance to say goodbye. The real-life relationship between Montenegro and Torres as mother and daughter adds authenticity to the transitions across time, making Eunice\'s portrayal even more heartfelt and believable. This genuine continuity allows Salles\' film to transcend mere fiction and reach a depth that only a personal story can achieve.\n\nTechnically, the film is a visual achievement that captures this family\'s intimate pain through meticulously crafted cinematography. The use of confined spaces and close-up shots reveals the characters\' physical and psychological confinement, mirroring the oppression that hangs over their lives. The soundtrack follows the most emotional scenes with an almost mystical quality, blending with the characters\' feelings like a whisper that holds the pains of the past. Salles\' use of music is interesting, not just to intensify the drama but to evoke an almost tangible nostalgia in the air, an echo of absences that can never be overcome. This balance between aesthetics and emotion transforms the film into both a tribute to interrupted lives and a celebration of the struggle for justice and memory.\n\nThe narrative avoids an easy or simplistic conclusion, choosing instead a more contemplative view on the lasting impact of loss. The film moves forward in time, showing us the future of each family member without offering conclusive or comforting answers. What remains is the pain, an indignation turned into strength, and a refusal to let difficult moments fade into oblivion. Rubens\' absence and the commitment of Eunice and her children to preserving his memory result in a catharsis for the audience, as it\'s both inspiring and deeply moving to see how they, even amid so much pain, resist the urge to let Rubens\' legacy be erased-and the film\'s goal to evoke tears was masterfully achieved, at least for me.\n\nOverall, ""I\'m Still Here"" is one of those rare historical films that, instead of adopting a documentary or openly critical stance, takes a humanistic approach that resonates with our deepest emotions and values. Salles proves his mastery as a filmmaker by crafting a story that is, at once, infuriating and inspiring-a work that reminds us of the importance of keeping the memories and voices of the wronged alive. Through a captivating narrative and an extraordinary cast, he turns the story of a Brazilian family into a universal reminder of human dignity and the importance of memory as a form of resistance.', ""Review of I'm Still Here\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say this is the best movie I've ever seen. I'm Still Here is a 10/10 masterpiece that captures the harrowing reality of Brazil's military dictatorship in the 1970s with a depth and sensitivity that is nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nThere's not a single thing they could've done better. From the soundtrack to the storytelling, I'm Still Here transcends being just a movie-it's a poignant tribute to resilience, family, and the fight for justice. It's a must-watch that will stay with you long after the credits roll.\n\nIt literally took me 10 minutes to get up and leave the movie theater."", '""I\'m Still Here"" is a movie about a time in which fear, censorship and torture prevailed in Brazil\'s history, a time that must never come back. However, director Walter Salles develops the theme in a delicate way, presenting us to an united and loving family which longs the return of a missing father and husband. It\'s possible to relate to Eunice\'s pain in so many moments and also imagine how cruel the military dictatorship must have been.\n\nThe movie has bittersweet moments and it builds a place where you feel close to that family, a place full of affection and tenderness. Fernanda Torres performance is amazing, she really deserves all the nominations she\'s going to get in the award season. Selton Mello also develops an outstanding performance as Rubens Paiva. The whole cast is superb and we also have the sublime Fernanda Montenegro as an older Eunice Paiva. The movie is technically beautiful, with a stunning representation of Rio de Janeiro in the 70\'s. I think i speak for a lot of brazilians when i say that it would be so much meaningful if Brazil gets nominated to the Oscars with this one, but despite that, it\'s definitely a must see, a recent masterpiece in brazilian cinema that raises awareness, delights and also might bring you to tears.', 'I mean no disrespect to the real people, their history, to all families that went through something like that. However, I think the movie did not depict the facts as deeper as I expected. Maybe I has better expectations when I saw the ratings here, the reviews...I think they have been biased and missed the basic point in a movie: ""to tell a story that convinces the audience"". It is touching, by one-sided, and missed details - if it was by chance or on purpose, I am not sure. It is like a good ""composition"" but someone missed the pace. It is important to a movie like that to go a little deeper. To ensure all t\'s are crossed and all i\'s are dotted. I didn\'t see that on this movie. The story is too linear, too by the book. It is OK, as I mentioned on my review, but it could be so much better. I think it could have expanded to other similar stories but I understand it was based on a book written by the protagonist\'s son, so it has ties and that\'s totally fair, fine but on a movie...it lacks the right vibe and power we expect given the ""story behind the story"". The actors did it but I totally missed the thrill of it.', ""Well, it's definitely not a movie for everyone. By the great hype the movie's been getting, I expected it to be way better.\n\nFor the big crowd It might be boring. For critics, it may be an interesting movie.\n\nLet me start by saying I understood its purpose. Historically, it's really important, but in terms of entertainment, it lacks tons of stuff, and the mean one is development and a good climax.\n\nThe movie could've explored more of the Brazilian dark times of dictadure, showing the great horror that the media hides up to these days. Therefore, it could've gotten deeper into the family's feelings. I think overall it was superficial and lacked emotion and interest.\n\nCentral Station, by the same director, is an exemple of excellence in Brazilian cinema. I went to the movies expecting something as big as his first hype.\n\nFernanda's acting, though, is out of discussion, and I think that's the only thing the movie's worthy of watching.\n\nAll the time I was like, Well, something great is going to happen, but the movie ended and that moment didn't come."", 'The most spectacular movie that Brazil has ever produced. Fernanda Torres impeccable.\n\nThe Oscar rarely goes to a country like Brazil, but it is undeniable how deep the film goes. The times of Brazilian dictatorship left deep marks that only a masterpiece like this film can highlight. Its necessary to be alert and strong. Watch it in the cinema and try to hold back your tears! Walter Salles: you are a genius!!!!! If necessary, reading about the real history of the characters in the plot can guide your understanding of the film. Knowing that it is something real makes everything even more impactful. Oscar!!!', 'It is rare for a film to move me to the point of feeling deep melancholy and sadness.\n\n""I\'m Still Here"" is one of the best films I\'ve ever had the pleasure of watching. What stands out the most is that it is Brazilian, from my homeland, made from the history of my country, from one of the darkest chapters of our past... And all of this is told through the story of a simple family, living simple, happy days, until a tragedy overwhelmed everything and took away that simple happiness.\n\nThe film does have its flaws, many of which are subjective to my perspective-things I would have done differently during the editing process. That\'s all. Overall, the film is exceptionally well-shot, with a beautiful soundtrack that makes great use of our Brazilian music. The performances are flawless in every sense. The comedic moments bring a light and laid-back tone, while the more intense scenes make it clear that the film aims to convey a heavy, realistic message, depicting events that marked our people.\n\nI am pleased to see that not only the world but also the Brazilian people are valuing this work.\n\nI truly hope that, at long last, the Oscars will recognize this achievement and honor our beloved Fernanda Torres-an actress who emerged from one of the greatest actresses in the world, Fernanda Montenegro, who remains unjustly overlooked by the Academy.', ""I'm Still Here is a very special film. It has a story that makes the viewer very interested in seeing how it unfolds. However, what this film has the best quality for is the Fernanda Torres' performance is moving, captivating, one of the best performances I've ever seen. It's truly surreal how talented she is, just like her mother. Furthermore, the film is directed by Walter Salles who had already worked on the excellent film Central Station, with Fernanda Montenegro, in this film he shows himself to be very competent. He is a very talented guy in what he does. Overall, I'm Still Here is the best foreign film of the year, a beautiful movie."", 'The outstanding acting! I remember learning about the fact of the Brazilian dictatorship pretty young. We learn about it at school. I was probably around 11 the first time I heard about it, and as kids, as we grow, we keep learning more about it throughout time, but, you know, it\'s History... A boring subject from school for which we barely memorize the dates and headlines of the historical events in order to have good grades at the end of the semester. I heard about it my whole life, my grandparents lived it as adults, even so, the memories got carried away. ""The Brazilian military dictatorship"" becomes simply a brunch of meaningless words. The scars are all that\'s left. Having said that, this makes the moment of watching this movie the moment I felt the weight of our History on my shoulders and my heart for the first time. Fernanda Torres\' acting took me to the edge where her character finds herself after her world crumbles down. I had to remember to breath a few times. Agony, anxiety, empathy. I could feel her pain, her strength, and yet, she does it in a way that made me cry from watching her holding her tears. It moved me. And that\'s what art is for. That\'s what this movie is. It\'s art, it\'s a memory, it\'s resistance.', ""I'M STILL HERE is a poignant and heart-wrenching film that sheds light on Brazil's military dictatorship, focusing on the tragic story of Eunice Paiva and her fight for justice after the disappearance of her husband, Rubens Paiva. Fernanda Torres delivers an extraordinary performance as Eunice, capturing the emotional complexity of a woman torn between hope and despair. Her portrayal is so compelling that she could very well be a contender for an Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nThe film's direction is both sensitive and impactful, showcasing the harsh realities of a dark period in Brazil's history. The cinematography complements the narrative, highlighting the tension, fear, and the quest for truth in a politically turbulent environment.\n\nDespite the film's heavy subject matter, it is ultimately a testament to the resilience of those who fought against oppression, making I'M STILL HERE not just a film about loss, but also about the strength of the human spirit."", ""Masterpiece.\n\nDelicate, sensitive, and yet so incredibly strong and sad.\n\nEveryone should watch this.\n\nFernanda Torres as Eunice Paiva is one of the most beautifully played carachaters I have ever seen.\n\nI'm Still Here displays the cruelty, sadness and unbelievable days Brazil went through during the dictatorship. Walter Salles' loving touch is there on every scene and makes the movie one very emotional piece that will make you wonder how is it possible to show such a horrible moment with so much kindness, subtilty, and sensitivity. Absolutely genius! A must watch. Definitely Foreign Language Movie favorite on the award season."", ""One of the best films of all time. I dont have to many words, it means more than just Brazil history, it recreates the reality of dictatures all around the world. Salles bring us one touch of reality beyond frontiers, i NEED to watch it again, so many pieces left behind around the 1970's south america crisis, Montenegro steals the show in my opinion with the best expression of pain im front of pur eyes, while the director creates a new point of view around the terrorism of the military forces. HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME, SALLES?\n\nIn other words, just give the oscar to montenegro and salles (and maybe screenplay as well)."", 'Being Brazilian, it pains me to say the movie disappointed me a little.\n\nOf course we love Fernanda Torres and Selton Mello, which have had good performances, but I was expecting more depth, more interesting script and dialogues, more story. It all felt kind of basic, as if we touched just the surface of everything that happened.\n\nAll this screen time spent with the kids didn\'t add much to the film.\n\nAs a comparison, the Colombian movie ""Memories of my Father"" (2020), which has a similar storyline (the life of a professor and his family during dictatorship) is much more profound, with a thicker plot, and therefore is more memorable.\n\nOn the other hand, this must be one of the best Brazilian movies ever, along with Central do Brasil, Cidade de Deus, o Auto da Compadecida, Tropa de Elite e O Homem que Copiava (and that\'s it).\n\nHaving said all that, I think it\'s worth the watch, for historic knowledge. It has nice cinematography and good production picturing the 70\'s.', ""The movie takes place in Brazil, during the early 70's, when a wife and mother lost her husband, a former local Congressman.\n\nSupposedly, he was killed by the local military, during interrogation about the location of communist guerrillas that were active in Brazil at that time.\n\nDespite the interesting background story, however, the movie is a slow burner, and never really takes off.\n\nThe acting seemed a bit uneven, sometimes giving a soap opera feeling to the scenes, but it's hard to tell whether or not this was on purpose.\n\nHowever it may be, all the hype around this film doesn't seem to make much sense. Not a total waste of time, but it would be quite safe to skip it."", ""Oh my god this movie its so good,The performances are impeccable, and Fernanda Montenegro is an amazing actress. Every moment she's on screen, she shines. Her acting conveys so many emotions with just her gaze. In my opinion, she is the best actress in this film. The competition is tough, as every actor brings their role to life.\n\nThe story is heartbreaking to the point of tears. As someone from Brazil, I deeply understand each subject it tackles, which brings an overwhelming sense of sadness. There are moments in this film when I didn't stand up only because I was in the theater. A well-deserved 10/10, not only for the fantastic acting but also for the heart-wrenching story.

So I've been counting the days and dreading, and when I heard the runtime I was even more distraught. I wanted to hate this movie with every bone in my body for a few reasons.\n\n1. Not a fan of musicals (but I can grimace through them sometimes).\n\n2. I love Wizard of Oz in its purest form and didn't want the legacy of it spoiling.\n\n3. My wife's choices of films are more often than not 'questionable'.\n\n4. Two hours plus in a cinema seat these days doesn't do my back any good at my age.\n\n5.

Everything from the phenomenal soundtrack, set design, make up, costumes,comedy elements, character design etc...i could go on, you get the gist. It was brilliant, I may even go watching it again (the highest accolade I can give for a two hours plus movie) and I can't wait for part 2. A few purists have got thier complaints and gripes which there will always be on adaptations of previous pre-loved formats. But no complaints here, just a very good, well made movie. Wizard of Oz's legacy intact.\n\nOne more point...Ariana Grande steals it for me. Perfect casting!!!"", ""I don't know much about the musical, but I'm familiar with the classic Judy Garland version, The Wizard of Oz. The world-building in this film is the best since Harry Potter and delivers everything you'd want from a fantasy experience. It looks, sounds, and feels exactly as a great fantasy movie should. Ariana Grande brings her own unique personality to Glinda, blending charm with a playful, modern energy that feels fresh and exciting. Cynthia Erivo delivers a powerful and heartfelt performance as Elphaba, infusing the character with raw emotion and a profound sense of strength. Their on-screen chemistry makes every scene between them unforgettable, elevating the story's magic and emotional depth. Can't wait for part two!"", ""Got to see a few hours ago in IMAX which was magnificent even my sister was there and I'm pretty sure both loved it! Wicked should be up for awards especially for set design, acting and directing are all great aspects. I'm generally not a fan of musicals but glad I saw this wild ride a couple days before the wide release. Cynthia and Ariana Grande were exceptional throughout they both deserve praise for their performances/exciting vibes! I had a long day I was little achy that was my complication otherwise this was delightful charming gem that will most likely be appreciated by most audiences as should be."", 'I saw the prescreening of the movie yesterday and saw the musical in London\'s West End years ago. In both cases what a show!\n\nI have been waiting for this release since the original project had Stephen Daldry tied to it and he exited due to ""scheduling conflicts"". Winnie Holzman iwrote both the book of the musical and the screenplay. She shines in both instances, however the movie being longer than the whole muscial (160min vs 150min), and representing only act 1, she had the chance to put in more layers and definetely more humour.\n\nDirector Jon M. Chu does not miss a brat with this amazing aource material and screenplay.

A lot of marvelous details down to the peculiar language of certain words in the screenplay to make it one of the best movies of 2024 (Oscar noms for sure) and one of the best movie muaical of all time. Can\'t wait for part 2 next year in movie theaters and may have to go see it in Broadway live again before that\n\nMoreover (and not a small point) the underlying message of resilience and resistance to fear-mongering authority, falsehood and justifications, divison, oppression and manipulation of public opinion is much needed in this decade of deceipt.\n\nFree speech and democracy?\n\nLet\'s all Defy Gravity!!!', 'In an era where musicals are deemed unsafe and a guarantee box office poison, Wicked defies gravity and transcends expectations. Not only are the songs infectious and emotionally resonate, but the acting from the cast is equal to the strengths of the music. The movie is visually striking, and though it\'s a lengthy runtime, the journey the viewer goes on is well worth the trip, leaving one enthralled when the ""To Be Continued"" pops up on screen.\n\nWhat is also unheard of for a movie musical is being a two parter. I wouldn\'t be surprised if Wicked: Part 1 sweeps this year\'s awards, and Part 2 does another sweep, something that is unprecedented in the history of movies.', ""WOW!!!

Every scene she is in I couldn't help but laugh. There is no doubt in my mind that she'll be nominated for an Oscar and hopefully brings it home. The last scene/song by Erivo is breathtaking and I cannot stop thinking about it. Even though it's a bit long at two and a half hours it certainly flies through it and every frame is magnificent.

And the actor who plays Elphaba is also very talented.\n\nApart from the fact I don't think Wicked has the best story line, the movie made the best out of it, in my sincere opinion. Direction is great!\n\nI didn't know they would split it in two, so I was expecting the whole story in this movie, but I think it is better this way, because they can explore all the story, the development of the characters etc.\n\nArt direction is a 10/10. Singing also perfect. Watch it, you won't regret it!"", ""As a theatre kid and long-time lover of The Wizard of Oz and Wicked, I had high hopes for this film and prayed it would be all that and so much more. And that it was!\n\nThe performances, especially by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, are Oscar-worthy. We see a whole new side to their insane talents and what they're truly capable of doing. Throughout the film, I had forgotten that it was Ariana as Glinda, because I saw her fully embody this role in the way that she said she would. She is HYSTERICAL and the whole theater couldn't stop giggling. Cynthia is an absolute powerhouse that left me left speechless after each star-studded performance. Having followed her journey for a while now, it came at no surprise the amazing beauty and strength she gave Elphaba. Together, they were radiating power, friendship and emotion.\n\nThe chemistry of the entire cast was lively and formed an environment that felt ethereal, along with the groundbreaking visuals of the settings! Wow. Just wow. It was beyond believable, and felt as if I was there, immersed in this world of Oz the entire film. And no, the trailers do not do this film justice and they don't spoil ANYTHING!\n\nThe musical numbers were traveling throughout my heart and soul, and it was an out of body experience that I will never forget.\n\nThis deserved two parts, and I see EXACTLY why it was split up. Yes, the film is long, BUT there is never a dull moment that arises. Each scene, each exchange is filled with its own magic.\n\nAriana, Cynthia, Jonathan, Jeff, Michelle, Ethan, Marissa, and the entire cast truly put their own unique twist on the songs, on the characters, all while paying homage to the original and to the Broadway show.\n\nTo Jon, this is what real cinema is. The camerawork and directing was something I had never seen carved. You have shattered the bar and allowed for more creativity to flow through and take over. Transcending time, going above and beyond the status quo and bringing us into the story. You absolutely nailed it and left no room for error. You truly defied gravity.\n\nBravo!"", ""I genuinely wanted to love this film and was so disappointed with it in the end. I really enjoyed the West End play and so was keen to see this version. Boy did it drag. It was about 1 hour too long. The set was lovely, the characters were ok and some of the songs were upbeat enough to engage, but overall it just wasn't captivating enough. I didn't even like most of the musical score. At times it actually made me cringe and I wished for it to end. I know most people seem to love it, but I just couldn't. I tried, but I wanted to escape by the second hour. It was just far too long and not captivating enough to keep me interested."", ""Powerful performances, most moving movie I've seen in years! Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande had breathtaking performances. A wonderful mix of humor and deep connection and emotions. I'm not a musical theater person but I was wonderfully surprised! Jonathan Bailey brings such a charm and lovable nature to Fiyero. The whole cast was phenomenal and it's the most moving film I've seen in years! I will definitely be watching this over and over again. All of the songs were so very pleasant. The sequences to the those scenes are amazing. It was all just... amazing. Something that I think most everyone will be able to connect with."", ""With the raving reviews surrounding this movie, there was an expectation for so much more. Throughout the progression of the film, I kept waiting for the moment where the movie became an instant classic in my books. However, it never did. With a 2-hour and 40-minute run-time, Wicked left me feeling drained. The vocals of the leads were immaculate, the props were grand, but something lacked.\n\nCynthia Erivo did an astounding job as Elphaba, in both acting and singing. She also garnered much sympathy for the plight of her character and the challenges she faced. Ariana held her own as Glinda bringing various quirks and comedy to her character, with her and Erivo's wonderful chemistry. Though, most of the characters seemed more superficial and not as easy to connect to.\n\nThere were moments in the film where it felt absolutely rushed, and moments that seemed to drag. Toward the final act, I loathed the idea of hearing another song. The plot seemed increasingly thin and unable to hold my attention. For a musical, most of the songs were forgettable, minus the finishing number 'Defying Gravity'. Admittedly, not all musicals need to have memorable songs if the plot is strong enough to carry it (e.g. Newsies), but the plot itself seemed just as forgettable.\n\nOverall, it is still a watchable movie despite its few flaws and bloated run-time."", 'Beautiful sets (with lighting), choreography, costumes, and great vocalists who anre more than capable of what is asked of them. It also has solid sound capture, edit, and flow, though there is a heavy-hand on the volume fader - I suspect to wake up the audience periodically as the plot crawls forward. And there\'s the rub - the story drags - this movie lumbers along with no respect for the audience. The movie ends with ""To be continued"", but I have no interest in seeing the next chapter of this director\'s ego trip.\n\nAnd though it\'s a musical, I did not leave the theatre with an earworm. No hooks, just a lot of excess dialogue put to music.\n\nGive it a pass.', ""I can't quite wrap my head around all the positive comments for this film, they go so far that it is almost suspicious.\n\nAnyway, me and my partner looked at each other after 1 hour and nodded to each other that it was time to leave. The storyline was going nowhere and it was frankly dull. I was really disappointed after reading some of the reviews for it, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't that. It was so predictable that I could sit there and mouth the next line before they even said it, the cinematography was pretty average too, for me there wasn't much to like about it. Perhaps kids would enjoy it more? Sorry but I won't be watching P2."", 'I had the pleasure of seeing the Broadway production of Wicked in New York back in 2008. Whilst I had my complaints (specifically around the second act), there was no denying that the music and sets created something magical that I am happy to say Jon Chu has managed to capture with this film.\n\nBoth Erivo and Grande give enchantingly memorable performances as the leads. It was clear both actresses took the time to think about how these characters should transition from stage to film without feeling silly or misrepresented. The supporting characters also all gave strong performances and fit their roles well.\n\nThe production design, costumes, and makeup in this film are all excellent. It does a great job of transporting you to the land of Oz and it was clear there was a huge amount of attention to detail.\n\nThe musical numbers were never not entertaining, with an energy that allowed the choreography and set pieces to shine, as well as the performances.\n\nThis film is only half of the story and ends the same way as Act 1 from the original musical. Similar to Dune, I feel this was poorly advertised, and may leave some people feeling mislead or unsatisfied.\n\nThe CGI in the film is used sparingly (mostly for the animals), but at times did feel distracting.\n\nOverall this was one of the best musicals I have seen in a very long time, and I am excited to see what they do with part 2.', 'I initially watched this movie in a Big D theatre on Monday as part of the Amazon Prime sneak peak. I just finished watching it for the second time and since I have one of those deals where you can watch 3 movies in a week, I will be going again this Sunday. To say that my expectations for this movie were unfair is an understatement...but, I\'ve seen this on staged and listened to the Broadway soundtrack for two decades. But, I can honestly say that this movie went far beyond my high expectations in delivering a movie that is hands down the best book to stage to movie adaptation I\'ve ever watched. As I sat there stunned with the rest of the audience on Monday, the only word I can think of is ""gobsmacked!"" Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were perfectly cast and managed to make Elphaba and Glinda their own while literally paying homage to Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. Grande is exceptional at comedic timing (anyone who\'s watched her on SNL knows she\'s hilarious); but, it\'s when there are more nuanced moments between her Glinda and Erivo\'s Elphaba where she is at her best. And Erivo\'s performance? MIND BLOWING! The depth of emotions she conveys with her eyes are scene stealing! Supporting cast is great but I will not be surprised if both Grande and Erivo nab Oscar nominations for this movie.', 'This movie is by far one of the best movies of all time. The director is a genius and the actors did an amazong job!!! Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo are not only able to showcase big emotions but also are in a superior league when it comes to vocal performance. Arianas powerful vocals combined with extrodinary vocal control are able to get you to tears as well as the power and pureness of Cynthia Erivos voice. Both of them as well as the other actors are able to push you to tears but also get you to joy. Especially Grande has a great sense of humor and is going to make you laugh throughout the movie!', ""I agree with the other reviewers. This is a masterpiece. I'm also not a fan of musicals but boy am I glad I saw Wicked. You feel sympathy for Elphaba throughout the movie. I almost felt like I could relate to Elphaba. I'm sure many of us can relate to her, being misunderstood and feeling like an outcast. I almost wanted to cry in the beginning of the movie. I was blown away. The special effects, the acting and the cinematic elements to the movie was top notch. I plan to go see it again. I went to go see the early premiere, at first I thought the movie was gonna suck but I was wrong. This movie is magnificent. I liked watching the chemistry between Cynthia and Ariana. They deserve an award for their roles, the acting and the performance was good from beginning to end. I am so glad I went to see this."", ""Cinema is back on! 'Wicked' casts a spellbinding charm on the big screen! Director John M. Chu masterfully adapts Gregory Maguire's beloved novel and the stage show, bringing Oz's iconic witches to life. Cynthia Erivo shines as Elphaba, complexity and depth radiating from every note. Ariana Grande dazzles as Glinda, comedic timing and vulnerability perfectly balanced. Their chemistry ignites a poignant exploration of friendship, prejudice, and self-discovery. A must-see musical spectacle for the whole family, probably the biggest movie of the year and a big award contender. Could it give movies like 'Titanic' and 'Return of the King' a run for their money??"", ""The stage play is far more enjoyable; pacing of the storyline and characters you really care about more than in this film. This movie definitely did not need to be a two-parter if the stage play can offer all the storyline and less time. I hope that there is a better cut of this film released when the second half comes out with the whole storyline, not exceeding 2 1/2 hours. These characters in this film seem so superficial. I'm not sure how you can compare this to the stage play. I feel that everything feels so fake in this movie compared to the stage play there could've been better use of all this extended time with more storyline.."", ""I will definitely be seeing this again in the theater. The casting was perfect, the talent acting and singing was astounding!! I love the music and the musical and it was so hard not to sing along. Chu is such a good director and so glad they got him to direct yhis movie. It has been 10 years since I've seen the musical but he seemed to stay true to the Broadway adaption of the book. I can not wait until part 2 or when I can watch this at home and sing and dance along with the movie. Don't miss this in the theater, it is so big it needs to be experienced on the big screen. Fabulous job everyone!!!"", ""There are a few things about this film that just really didn't work for me, but there is also lots to enjoy. On balance it makes for a perfectly watchable and entertaining enough experience, but it could have and should have been so much better.\n\nTo start with the positives, Ariana Grande is absolutely magnificent as Glinda. I was sceptical about her as a leading actress but she really smashes it out of the park. Vocally she is spot on. Her mannerisms and dialogue delivery are perfect. She truly eclipses every other cast member and just is Glinda in every way.\n\nAesthetically in terms of costuming and set design, again I think this film nails it. The commitment to practical sets and a reduction in green screen technology is noticeable and it does create a more engaging look to the film.\n\nFinally the production value of the music numbers is all really solid. Apart from dragging out Defying Gravity for a bit too long, I think the songs are all brilliantly performed and well choreographed.\n\nNow for my gripes...\n\nThe whole thing is just far, far too long. Two hours and forty minutes? There is simply no need. Not only this but somehow, despite all this extra breathing room, the film doesn't carry as much emotion in its story as the theatre production. I felt like the plot points around the animals and also of Elphaba wanting to meet the wizard, just didn't carry as much weight as they should. There was just too much time between the emotional beats of the story due to the added run time, which lessened their impact.\n\nI can't argue that she has a great voice (and she nails Defying Gravity), but I just wasn't convinced by Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba. Perhaps this is on the director's shoulders, but she was just played a little too reserved and shy and was incredibly hard to connect to. I know this is part of the character of Elphaba, but even still the whole performance was just too muted. It doesn't help that she was performing across from a great Glinda.\n\nAnother annoyance is the colour palette of the film which is disappointingly dull. Given the technicolor wonder of The Wizard of Oz, I was hoping this film would pop a little more on the screen. Glinda's pink dresses, Elphaba's green skin, even the Emerald City itself... they just all felt a bit dull.\n\nStill, none of these gripes are terminal. If you enjoyed the stage show of Wicked you will love this film. If you love musicals you will enjoy this film. Even if you are just a casual movie goer you will find plenty to enjoy here. I do just think given the source material there was maybe a better attempt to be had here."", ""If you are primarily interested in movies without being a fan of the original Wicked musical or this particular IP, I would take these somewhat strangely overwhelming positive reactions with a grain of salt. It's nice to see people enthusiastic about big Hollywood extravaganza but this is far, far, very far away from a masterpiece which is so forcefully implied by many major media outlets. First of all, this being Part 1 with a running time of 160 minutes while the whole original musical was shorter than that, tells you enough about the intentions and corporate machinery behind this project.\n\nThe positive side besides perhaps 2-3 musical numbers being fun and charming are the performances from Cynthia Orivo and Ariana Grande. They have nice chemistry together and they are obviously great singers. Jonathan Bailey also has fun screen presence and I definitely wanted to see a bit more of him. Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum aren't doing that much here, typical paycheck gigs, no more and no less.\n\nStory is fine, I guess. It has super basic messages about acceptance, being true to yourself, standing up and, and... really basic stuff without any ambiguity to it. However, the pacing is atrocious, film dragged at times and an obnoxiously pedestrian editing didn't help at all. After some time, I simply wanted it to end - again, this is Part 1, so spoilers - it won't end until November 2025.\n\nAnd how are the visuals? This is one of the worst looking big studio movies I have seen in a very long time - think Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland mixed with MCU's bland colour grading and horrendous lighting that makes everything artificial, soulless and flat. It's astonishing how even the prettiest practical sets can be demolished with post-production in wrong hands. This is a movie where visual components are crucial, it should create that cinematic and magical sense of wonder - remember beautiful Technicolour vibrancy in 1939s Wizard of Oz? Well, that's replaced with the ugliest colour palette you can find in modern film.\n\nWicked (Part 1!) will be a hit, it's tailored to be, forced into being the ultimate crowd pleaser but the fact that such an unimaginative and borderline lazy and toothless filmmaking is so highly praised, called even a MASTERPIECE, that's the reason why mainstream film industry isn't about art, creativity or originality anymore, it's almost exclusively about corporations creating marketing juggernauts and pleasing the target audience with the safest and the most basic content without the ounce of artistic instincts that are usually needed to mold motion pictures into art. Just like Sir Scorsese once commented on these huge riskless crowd-pleasing corporate events, this is not a cinema, this is something else."", 'To my surprise, ""Wicked"" was my most anticipated film of the year. Sure, movies like ""Deadpool & Wolverine,"" ""Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,"" and ""Beetlejuice Beetlejuice"" held my curiosity and cautious optimism, and I had the same feelings toward ""Wicked"" at first. However, the fantastic trailers won me over to the point where every time they played before another film, I couldn\'t help but get excited. I\'ve never seen the original Broadway show, but the Judy Garland-starring ""The Wizard of Oz"" is my childhood. I even saw its dark yet enchanting unofficial sequel ""Return to Oz"" and Sam Raimi\'s Tim Burton-esque ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" in preparation for this. The hype is real, so I would be upset if it fell flat - but it didn\'t! The film fan and critic in me loved ""Wicked,"" and I\'d like to talk about why.\n\nThe acting and singing were stellar around the board. Cynthia Erivo was spectacular as Elphaba, the titular Wicked Witch of the West. Erivo brought gravitas when portraying the human side of the famous villain, especially considering this film is her origin story. I also can\'t forget Ariana Grande as Glinda. Musicians have always had trouble transitioning into acting, with Eminem\'s performance in ""8 Mile"" almost always in the conversation of artists who succeeded. I\'ve seen Grande in other films before, and her role in ""Hairspray Live!"" was entertaining, but these performances haven\'t proven her as a professional. ""Wicked"" changes that, as this interpretation of Glinda seemed to have Grande in mind from the start, and it\'s better because of it. The rest of the cast performed skillfully, with other standouts being Peter Dinklage as Dr. Dillamond and Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero Tigelaar. Bailey steals the show, as Tigelaar is an incredibly whimsical and hilarious supporting character who may win you over.\n\nI have to give proper recognition to Director Jon M. Chu. He directed this hugely ambitious, large-scale tentpole like a pro, and I respect him for accomplishing this possibly wearying task.\n\nEven though studios nowadays try to hide that these movies are musicals, the trailers didn\'t entirely cover it up. As a musical, it was outstanding. See ""Joker: Folie à Deux,"" this is how you do a musical! All the songs and ensuing musical sequences were extraordinary, with ""The Wizard And I,"" ""Popular,"" and ""Defying Gravity"" being the highlights for me. The songs are paired with impeccable choreography, costume, and set designs from Christopher Scott, Paul Tazewell, and Nathan Crowley.\n\nThe CGI was unbelievable, bringing many elements, including the animals, to stunning life. It enhances the magic feel of this film, and the fact the movie cost $145M overall and had exceptional visuals is jaw-dropping. Speaking of which, I\'m sorry, ""Mega-flop-olis,"" though I still think your visuals are mind-blowing, ""Wicked"" has taken your title as the most impressive film visually this year. It goes without saying that ""Red One"" spending $250M might have resulted in great visuals, but how they spent less here is more commendable.\n\nRegarding the narrative, it wonderfully flips the original Wizard of Oz story on its head. Again, this is the story of how the Wicked Witch of the West came to be. There is a sense that the gleeful characters we knew from the original may have helped the Wicked Witch become her namesake.\n\nAdditionally, I laughed many times. In particular, Erivo, Bailey, and Grande\'s characters have hilarious exchanges that made the entire theater I was in laugh, and I couldn\'t help being part of that crowd. Dana Fox and Winnie Holzman deserve credit for having a remarkable screenplay.\n\nFinally, the runtime was surprisingly well-utilized. Before going into detail, I must mention why I had cautious optimism about this film before the trailers. There are two reasons: this was part one of two, and it runs at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I was unsure if this film would drag or have any unnecessary scenes. After seeing it, I am pleased to report I wasn\'t bored or upset with any of the scenes or pacing decisions. Very few films have this runtime and utilize it flawlessly.\n\nIn conclusion, I fell in love with ""Wicked,"" and it is difficult for me not to. In a year with incredible films, ""Wicked"" manages to stand above most of the rest and is one I feel has a strong chance of winning the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nTechnically, the performances from actors like Erivo and Grande, the breathtaking visuals, M. Chu\'s magnificent direction, the script, and the pacing add to a 10/10 masterpiece.\n\nFor the enjoyment score, we rarely see a film outside of animated features that appeal to all audiences. I believe that younger and older audiences alike will love this absolute treasure. The enjoyment score is a well-deserved 10/10! If this is one of the year\'s best films, ""Gladiator II"" has a long way to go to be the victor of ""Glicked."" This musical is a must-watch in theaters, and I can\'t wait for ""Wicked Part Two""!', ""Cynthia. My dear Cynthia. You brought out feelings in me that I didn't know needed expression. I have never been so moved by an Elphaba portrayal. You were flawless. No one could have done it better than you. You created an Elphaba that everyone can relate to and see themselves in.\n\nAriana Grande-Butera, you were the best surprise. I knew you'd be good but I wasn't prepared for how much you'd exceed my expectations. You were right, you took care of her.\n\nJonathan Bailey. The world is discovering your greatness one project at a time and I can't wait to see them all.\n\nThe cast is nothing short of phenomenal.\n\nJon M. Chu. Thank you for doing it right. Thank you for this beautiful portrayal of the musical we all know and love while bringing it to screen with your own beautiful twists and vision.\n\nIf I could, I would live in the theatre and watch this on a loop. This movie helped me find a piece of me I lost 10 years ago as a theatre girl. Thank you for bringing it back."", 'I\'m not the biggest fan of musicals, but when they\'re very extremely well done like this one they leave me on a high for days. The level of effort and obvious passion put into every aspect of this movie is astonishing.\n\nThe main two actresses completely knocked it out of the park. Grande\'s Galinda is a showstopper you keep on waiting for to reappear on the screen. I was never really convinced of her acting abilities before, but now it\'s the complete opposite case. Ariana Grande has so much more to offer through musical and film than solely the popstar gig. Cynthia\'s Elphaba is striking and powerful. While she gets kind of overshadowed by Galinda in the first half of the movie, she completely takes over later on.\n\nI can\'t wait to see the two of them performing ""Defying Gravity"" at the next Oscar\'s ceremony. It\'s a moment certain to happen.\n\nI\'d also like to point out what a heartfelt actor Jeff Goldblum is. Completely in love with him.\n\nI\'ll be back at the cinema asap rewatching it 😁', 'Okay, this movie had me laughing, crying, and humming ""Defying Gravity"" for hours after. Elphaba is the ultimate underdog queen, and Glinda\'s bubble-blowing, overly dramatic fabulousness stole the show. The visuals? Insane. Oz looks like Pinterest exploded in the best way possible.\n\nAnd the music? Ugh, perfection. I can\'t wait for part 2! My goosebumps got goosebumps the entire movie. Plus, who doesn\'t love a story about friendship, a little shade, and sticking it to the haters? Whether you love the musical or have no clue what ""Oz"" is, go see Wicked. It\'s magical. ✨\n\nI\'ll be seeing this again in theaters and buying for home as soon as I can!', ""Let me first say - NO ONE IS PAYING ME FOR MY REVIEW!\n\nSecondly - I have seen the musical play THREE times on a professional stage. Unfortunately - not on the Broadway stage - but at The Buell in Denver.\n\nIs the movie perfect? NO. That's why I am giving it a 9. It is a little long; but after seeing the play - I am not sure what they could have cut out. The play runs close to three hours WITH an intermission. There are no special effects in the play - you must use your imagination (which is one of the reasons why a play is fun). NOW ON TO THE MOVIE!\n\nThey did a wonderful job of taking a highly successful play to the big screen. The special effects are really good and enhance the telling. They did not spend too much time on any aspect of the story. The music. The acting. The singers. All really good. No - not all singers are great singers! I loved Michelle Yeoh singing. She's not a singer - but she did a great job. Same with Jeff Goldblum.\n\nFor the record - this is not the Judy Garland Wizard of Oz. This story is based on a book by Gregory Maguire. It tells the story of how the Wicked Witch and Glinda came to be the Wicked Witch of the West and the Good Witch of the North. It has no Dorothy. No cowardly lion. No tin man. And NO scarecrow (stay tuned for part 2 ... that's another story). The witch Dorothy's house falls on is in part 1 - but that won't be explained until part 2.\n\nI was quite concerned with the casting chosen for Elphaba and Glinda - but was very pleasantly surprised. They both were wonderful. Ariana Grande shows just the right amount of innocence, self-importance, conceit, selfishness needed for Glinda. Cynthia Erivo shows Elphaba's lack of confidence, lack of self-esteem, wallflower personality. Fiyero's lack of caring, mindlessness et al was perfectly portrayed by Jonathan Bailey. Again - stay tuned for part 2 to learn more.\n\nThis movie is fantastic! Go see it - but DO NOT expect The Wizard of Oz. It's not THAT story. If you go expecting it - you will be disappointed. If you go expecting to be entertained ... you will love it. Pay close attention ... the original Elphaba and Glinda from Broadway gave cameos. It was a nice touch and tribute to the two who first made the characters come to life!"", ""One of the best films I've see in a long time.\n\nI had no expectations going into this and although I was slightly concerned at the long run time I was so immersed into the film that it felt like 5 minutes!\n\nAll of the actors were incredible, the singing was incredible, the sets looked amazing!\n\nAfter watching the film I saw online that they actually sang live while filming which much take incredible talent. I hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves. I think it will turn into a classic that we will watch every Christmas just like the wizard of oz.\n\nThe only problem I have is that I have 2 wait until next year for part 2!"", ""2 hours and 40 minutes and this is only Part 1?! Nowhere except for in the cinema did I see the film advertised as PART 1-not in the advertising, not in the cinema listing, and not on the marquee. I don't think I would have gone knowing there were more parts coming. And since Wicked was just as long as a musical and had a beginning, middle, and an end in that same amount of time, it means that they should tell the entire story in about 9 hours. Yes the creativity of the sets and the CGI of animals were amazing, and the leads were pretty good especially since they had big shoes to fill. Cynthia & Ariana held their own, and Ariana may have a second career as she was awesome on SNL as an actor. Jonathan Bailey was a standout for sure, and can obviously sing and dance and came across as completely swoon worthy. Bowen Yang gave the film some camp and humour. But I guess we have a couple of more films to give a solid rating. Is it a 1/10?-no, that's too harsh, maybe not your cup of tea or too long. Is it a 10/10?!-no you might be fanning out on Wicked The Musical, Ariana, or Cynthia a little too much and perhaps you need a restraining order. But somewhere in the middle seems appropriate, until we see the subsequent parts."", ""I hardly bother with writing these, but Wicked truly deserves a shout-out. From the opening scene to the final note, the movie is a spellbinding spectacle that brings the beloved musical to life in the most enchanting way. The casting is spot on, with each actor breathing fresh energy into their roles while staying true to the original characters. The visuals are stunning, seamlessly blending whimsical set designs with breathtaking special effects that transport you to Oz.\n\nThe music, of course, is a showstopper-classic songs reimagined beautifully while keeping their emotional impact intact. The chemistry between the leads, particularly in their evolving friendship, is heartfelt and adds depth to the story. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the musical or entirely new to the tale, Wicked is a magical experience that leaves you humming long after the credits roll. Don't miss it!"", ""First of all, how the director missed the most colourful film of the century?? World of Oz is supposed to be full of florescent colours, brightest shades of everything etc. What a waste or cheap work?\n\nI loved Ariana Grande's character, on the other hand someone should zoom out the camera. It was hard to watch those crowded dance scenes in the emerald city. There are some major issues with the timeline of the story and cuts made by the director. We are wasting a giant part of the story yet this is only the FIRST chapter. Felt like we were watching 4th episode or something. I hope the second part will be better."", ""As many people have said and I would agree the vibrancy of the land of Oz didn't come through as well as you would expect.\n\nCynthia, although a fabulous talent, didn't completely draw me in as much as needed to create the sympathy for her character. She was very good but there was just a little something that was off for me. The final song of defying gravity was very strung out and by the end Cynthia's note (which isn't my favourite way of singing it) was very much, come on get it over with please. I think the filming choice did her a disservice on this song.\n\nAriana Grande started off strong and I thought she was going to be excellent however I found she became quite one note as the movie progressed. She had moments of greatness but didn't go all the way for me.\n\nThe whole film was very drawn out, in order to make two movies. This meant it lost the pace and drive that those who have seen the musical will remember. There were periods of time I was board watching.\n\nThe cameos with Menzel and Chenoweth were misguided. I understand the sentiment and the reasoning and as a fan I wanted to see them in this film. However the moment was forced and distracting to the movie. There must have been a better way to showcase them.\n\nJust my personal gripe... Why is Boq taller than Glinda?\n\nThis film had great potential but for me it missed the mark."", ""This movie has left me speechless. For starters, I've never been too excited for a movie, ever. Yet the trailers for Wicked built up so much hype to the point where I couldn't wait to watch it. Unfortunately though, the trailers were nothing compared to the marvel that is the movie itself. The vocals, the choreography, the stunts, everything was just incredible. Knowing that everything was sung live really immerses you into the movie. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo each play their role flawlessly, and it is easy to tell how much effort, time, and determination they put in. My suggestion? Immediately go to your nearest cinema and experience this fantastic movie adaptation yourself. I will 100% be watching part 2."", ""That was the shortest film I've ever seen, it did not feel over 2 hours because of how good it was. I decided to watch it because the story was decent, I'm not one for musicals but the ending scene I cannot get out of my head, simply Exhilarating.\n\nThe acting was incredible aswell, the bond between Glinda and Elphaba was incredible. Looking forward to part 2 but I fear it cannot get any better than that.\n\nCynthia's voice is actually incredible, was such a great film, don't miss out, this is cinema gold.\n\nI'll await Part 2 now and hopefully it can keep up with what I've just seen, as it's not going to be easy."", 'Bro this is the best film i have watched all year. I was worried i would be underwhelmed or confused, but it did NOT disappoint, in fact it was even better than i ever could have imagined. Im going to the cinemas again tomorrow to rewatch it with my grandma because it was so good. I cried when glinda appeared on screen for the first time. I cried at multiple other points which i wont say for the sake of spoilers. I cried at the ending. It was an overall ethereal out of body experience. I left the cinema feeling reborn. As someone who has never watched/read wicked before, im so annoyed that ive been missing out on this MASTERPIECE for years. Cynthia, Ariana, and the rest of the cast, were all absolutely perfect and the 2 hours 41 minutes did not feel that long at all. Cant wait to watch it again.', ""I had very little interest in going to see this, but my daughter wanted to go... So like the poor, put-on father, I dragged myself along.\n\nIt was outstanding, I was chuckling along from start to finish - mostly at Arianna Grande who seemed to really enjoy playing the role everyone thinks is her in real life. Shallow, self involved and overly dramatic with the most wicked (pun intended) comic timing. She was really outstanding.\n\nThe effects are top class, the music is wonderful and the cast perfect. I walked out after the huge finale with a grin plastered onto my face - the sort I only get very occasionally with movies - the last time being Godzilla Minus One which was another astonishing surprise.\n\nGo see it. Allow it to sweep you up and carry you along. It's a ride that comes along very rarely."", ""Such a wonderful adaption. The story has room to breath and really makes the original stage book more comprehensible. ALL of the original music from Act 1 is included and includes so many Easter eggs to the 1939 film, 1985 Return To Oz, and the book from which it is based, it's not even funny. I've seen it twice and haven't caught everything yet. Fun cameos as well.\n\nI highly recommend. Don't let the haters sway you. The performances are a delight and I can't see a better production being mounted. It far outshines the original musical which is saying A LOT.\n\nIf you go, be sure to see it in Dolby for the best sound experience. IMAX is probably good too but the standard one was poor."", ""A fantastic movie! Just saw this in 3d. I'll be honest, AMC doesn't have the best sound af my local theater. It was hard to hear what they were saying in some of the songs, so that took away being submerged into the experience. That being said, the whole movie is beautiful, and they did a great job with the graphics. It captured the emotional story of wicked and the cast was great! I wasn't sure how I'd like Ariana as Glinda, but she fit the role perfectly! Elphaba was the star of the show! Great acting and looking beautiful in every scene! She made you relate and humanized the wicked witch well. Great Job on this one, I can't wait to see it again with better sound!\n\nWatched this in theater."", '""Wicked: Part I"" is a fantasy musical film based on the 2003 stage musical and 1995 novel of the same name by Gregory Maguire, which themselves are both based around L. Frank Baum\'s novel ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"". Directed by Jon M. Chu (""Now You See Me 2"", ""Crazy Rich Asians"") and starring Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, Michelle Yeoh, and Jeff Goldblum, it is a solid character study of two very different witches and the origins of their unlikely friendship.\n\nYears before the events of ""The Wizard of Oz"", the shy, reserved Elphaba Thropp (Cynthia Erivo) and the pampered, perky Galinda Upland (Ariana Grande) both arrive at Shiz University to study magic. Because of her prominent green skin, Elphaba is quickly judged and ridiculed by others whereas Galinda\'s bubbly personality gains her many friends among the students. After demonstrating a fraction of her power in front of the whole university, Elphaba attracts the attention of Headmistress Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), who decides to tutor her in private, much to the chagrin of Galinda. Eventually, Elphaba and Galinda are forcibly assigned together as roommates where their conflicting views often put them at odds with each other, leading to many fights and disagreements. Over time, the pair find themselves growing closer as friends after learning more about each other\'s personal lives, as well as delving deep into some dark, sinister secrets in relation to the history of the Land of Oz.\n\nFew modern fairy tales have captured our imaginations the way L. Frank Baum\'s ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" continues to do so up to this very day. Thanks to the classic 1939 film, Baum\'s Land of Oz lives on in the hearts and minds of several people the world over, even more than a century after the original novel was published. In the wake of the story\'s long-lasting popularity, various spin-offs and prequels in the form of books, comics, films, TV series, and stage productions have emerged to help keep it relevant within western pop culture, but hardly any have achieved the level of success like the 2003 Broadway musical ""Wicked"". After years of development, in 2024 we now have the first part of two film adaptations of this highly successful musical, which manages to translate surprisingly efficiently onto the big screen.\n\nServing as a prequel to the 1939 film, this story shows the audience the origins of its two distinguished witch characters; The Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good Witch. As the film begins, we see a mighty cheer go up among the citizens of Oz as they all celebrate the death of the Wicked Witch at the hands of Dorothy Gale. Amidst a town of celebrating Munchkins, Glinda suddenly appears in her bubble to check in on their festivities, where one of the young inhabitants inquires as to whether or not the two witches have ever crossed paths with each other. With a subtle hint of sadness, Glinda begins to tell the Munchkins about how she not only knew the Wicked Witch personally, but that she was actually once her closest friend when no one else wanted to be.\n\nAt this point, the film then flashes back several years earlier where we see the birth of Elphaba, whose green skin horrifies both her parents and everyone around them. As she grows older, Elphaba is subjected to numerous cruel reactions regarding her appearance, so much so that she even has a mentally scripted response ready for anybody polite enough to listen. In spite of her hardships, Elphaba still tries to be a good person, learning how to master magic and using it as a way to help others. This is later shown to us when we see Elphaba protect her wheelchair-bound younger sister Nessarose (Marissa Bode) from bullies using her developing magical powers.\n\nOn the other hand, the upbringing of Glinda, then known as ""Galinda"", was one of happiness and luxury. Her exuberant family life among the wealthy elite has turned her into something of a snob, viewing herself as of a higher social status than most others in the Land of Oz. All of this changes on her first day at Shiz University, where she becomes acquainted with Elphaba, whose unusual physical features causes her to stand out even more so than Galinda\'s predominantly pink fashion sense. This is where the film begins to examine the complex relationship between the two characters, exploring the vast differences in their demeanours and how they eventually find common ground. Being a musical, these moments are of course accomplished through some creative song and dance routines.\n\nHaving never watched the original musical live on stage, I am unable to properly compare this film to its source material, but from what I can gather it appears to be a faithful retelling of the story, albeit, in cinematic form. As such, I treated this film as I would any other musical, to which I can say it is very effective in the way it incorporates its music numbers into the plot. For instance, when Galinda and Elphaba are seen disagreeing with each other, the song ""What Is This Feeling?"" is used to showcase their contrasting personalities, whereas ""Dancing Through Life"" demonstrates how much the two have grown since their initial hostilities and have now become close friends. All of these moments feature catchy audio hooks and well-choreographed dance sequences which help the film stand out from other musicals while at the same time giving the impression it belongs to the same universe as ""The Wizard of Oz"".\n\nIn terms of visuals, the film looks vibrant and colourful, making it hard to look away during certain establishing shots. From the distinct pink of Galinda\'s wardrobe to the light-green interiors of the Emerald City, the film uses its colour palette quite efficiently. Not only that, but the overall production design is handled nicely too, with some interesting props for the cast of singers and actors to interact with during the musical numbers. However, there were a handful of scenes where it felt quite obvious that the actors were working in front of a green screen under the impression that the background will be made to look beautiful in post production. Though these moments weren\'t too common, they did stand out during times where I wanted to feel fully immersed in this fantastical world of Oz, which is something pretty important for a film like this.\n\nSince this is a two woman show, it feels necessary to praise both Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande at the same time. Each of these two actresses compliment the other perfectly with their conflicting dynamic being the main dramatic force that drives the plot forward. I actually found myself heavily invested in watching how Erivo\'s Elphaba grows increasingly darker over the course of the story whereas Grande\'s Galinda becomes less snooty and more humble as she learns the importance of true friendship. As an added bonus, both actresses did all of their own singing, which adds a sense of realism to their performances on screen. Of course, Erivo and Grande are no strangers to singing on stage as they have each performed in various other Broadway shows in the past. The only other two cast members worth mentioning are Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Jeff Goldblum as the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but as much as I would like to go into greater detail regarding their characters, I am unable to do so due to either spoilers or information that will likely be addressed in the film\'s second part.\n\nFor fans of both musicals and the ""Wizard of Oz"" series, the first film adaptation of ""Wicked"" succeeds not only at bringing the popular Broadway show to the big screen but also at adding some interesting backstory and lore to keep novices entertained for most of its 160 minute runtime. Granted, it is clear that the scope of the entire story is far too grandiose for just one film, which is why Part Two should hopefully cover everything else that wasn\'t properly examined here. Regardless, this first part of the story does a fine job setting the stage for things to come and leaves you with just enough to keep you satisfied before the follow-up eventually arrives. With that said, I can only hope its successor will conclude things on an equally enjoyable note, because I\'ll be waiting patiently until then.\n\nI rate it 8/10.', ""I went into this movie expecting big things. Now, the singers were great, and I can't deny the cast's talent, but as far as the timing and pacing of the film, it gets a significant deduction in stars for me.\n\nI don't love musicals, but having written that, I can't say that these productions are something I automatically shy away from.\n\nThree hours is a helluva long time to listen to and watch a movie with so much singing and nearly no dialogue outside of song lyrics.\n\nTo its credit, Wicked is shot cleanly and beautifully, and the balance of singing and character acting gets better, in my opinion, in the second half of the movie."", ""Before I start, I'm a big fan of the books and stage musical. I was very worried going into this.\n\nAriana. I was concerned when I heard this casting as I thought Ariana's voice (while brilliant) would be too recognisable as her own and not Glinda's. How I was wrong. She ABSOLUTELY nailed it AND didn't try to make it her own - she respected the character and did our good witch justice. Ariana embodied Galinda - sassy, cute and hilarious. I'm so happy with her portrayal and couldn't fault it.\n\nCynthia. Her vocal talent is undeniable and her portrayal of Elphaba's soft side and true character is fantastic. My only issue here is Cynthia trying to make Elphaba her own, especially in Defying Gravity. Songs were changed a little too much for my liking and missing that last note in defying gravity will forever annoy me. Overall, I *think* I'm happy with her portrayal, but I need to see more in part 2.\n\nJonathan. My lord, Dancing Through Life. A masterpiece. Shout out to set design, choreographers and dancers here too. I can't wait to see Jonathan's Fiyero shine more in part 2.\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by the film. I had to go into this with a pinch of salt due to my love for Wicked and the bad press and my own opinions on the leads, Ariana and Cynthia. But none of that mattered when watching. The film was fantastic. I'm just very annoyed that we have to wait a year for part 2."", ""Hollywood often takes adaptations and halfway creates them to just be a means to an end of gathering the money of a fan base. This didn't happen with Wicked. The film was handled with care and a keen eye. It holds extremely close to the stage play with its own movie magic flair. Even though I don't prefer some of the cast members otherwise, they were perfectly cast and played their characters with all of their being. This movie is movie musical perfection from the sets to all of the visuals to the vocals and music arrangement. The colors were as vivid as the emotions portrayed. The only thing disappointing is the wait for the second half."", ""*spoiler free*\n\nI never leave reviews. Ever. But I had to for this one.\n\nThe odds were against it. There's been a string of musical to movie flops over the last several years. It's been letdown after letdown. But wow. This one defied all the odds and outdid my very high expectations. I've seen Wicked on stage three times, once with Kristin and Idina, I have such a strong connection to this show. I didn't think the film could be as good as it was.\n\nThe casting is so spot on all around it's insane. Ariana was born to play Glinda, she truly was. And Cynthia Erivo, omg don't get be started because I won't stop. She knocked it out of the park as Elphaba. It's such a complex and beautiful character and she brought everything to her. Defying Gravity had me ugly crying in the theater. And that cameo... omg that cameo! I WEPT!\n\nPlease go see this. If you love Wicked go. Don't listen to the bad reviews. If you even just like some of the songs, go. It's worth it. I can't wait to go again!"", 'I am completely blown away of the movie version of Wicked. The script, the acting, the direction, the sets, the camera work, and the cinematography are all worthy of awards. My whole family has seen the play on Broadway and were concerned that the movie would not live up to that. The movie actually surpasses the play. They were able to do so much more with sets and camera work that you could never do in a play. Obviously, the singing is amazing, but it is really the story and the power behind the story and the song that make this work. The director, obviously does an amazing job. I think this will be a modern classic in film history.', ""Where to begin...to note I am a huge fan of the source material, having seen the musical over 45 times in 3 different countries and read the books several times. Not only of Wicked but of the world of Oz in general. This movie is not only a fantastic adaption but improves upon it, with the capability and time to add extra nuance to the Broadway show.\n\nFrom the opening moment I was in awe to see this movie come to life in front of my eyes, Oz has never felt so alive. The score and visuals, I had to catch my breathe. It immediately but my mind at ease and I knew this movie was in safe hands! The wait has been well and truly worth it, the right creatives under Jon M Chu and Cynthia and Ariana truly embody the roles of Elphaba and G(a)linda that it's hard to imagine anyone else even auditioned for this parts. Jonathan Bailey does a good job, but I must say wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, Ethan and Marissa are good editions however I'm mainly excited to see their roles in Part 2. Jeff Goldblum is Jeff Goldblum and Michelle Yeoh brings a more real, cold and calculated version of Madam Morrible that's suits the screen.\n\nI enjoyed all the songs, the changes they made felt right and fit the movie. The ending was phenomenal and I cried like hell, I was fully frozen into my seat. I will be seeing this again several times over. I did not feel the run time at all, it flew (pardon the pun) by and it felt like a complete movie."", ""I was so confused when I saw the west end production a few years ago even to the point I actually nodded off.\n\nHaving such amazing storytelling and visuals I was immersed in this from the first scene.\n\nCynthia and Ariana are magic. Their voices are heaven. You can see the contrast in their styles and chemistry between them. I've downloaded a couple of songs and hoping to see this movie again. The remaining cast are so diverse and that element alone gives a great edge.\n\nThis is cinema at its finest, go see it on the big screen for full effect. Agree this should be on the cards for awards, pure unaltered fantasy."", ""It was amazing! Cynthia as Elphie was seriously one of the best performances I've ever seen and Ariana was such a great Glinda and I couldn't see anyone else as her. Now for my man Jonathan Bailey who did such a incredible job as Fiyero. Jeff Goldblum was such a great wizard and everyone did amazing! The songs were perfect and defying gravity was something out of this world! I'm serious when I say no one could have played Elphaba better than Cynthia! Amazing!!!! 10/10 would recommend! I'm also serious when I say you will fall in love with this movie! Jon M chu did such an amazing job!! Love it."", 'This movie is LONG.... And it\'s mind-numbingly so if you do not like musical like myself.\n\nWith that in mind, this movie has broadway roots so ""over the top"" it definitely was in many ways, including in acting. . I know people say Cynthia did well , but her acting fell flat to me among all the other actors. The name of the movie is Wicked, but Grande definitely stole the show. I didn\'t care about the witches struggles and obstacles like I should have . I wasn\'t made to care about that character at all actually, which is strange to me. Usually I tend to root for the underdog characters but I didn\'t root for anyone really.\n\nThe CGI did its job, there were a few good songs. Overall, I was ready to leave at the two hour mark and had to sit there an extra 40 mins.. The silver-lining was that the movie did in fact end and my two eight year old girls did seem to like it even though they were starting to get pretty restless themselves. Again, it\'s a really long movie. They were excited to see there was a second Wicked coming out. I told them their dad can take them.', ""Without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen, a beautiful story about being different and how that affects your treatment by society. Every musical number felt like it was breathing life into me. The final scene will live in my soul for the rest of my life. I feel like Ariana Grande was a polarizing choice going into this film but I can say that she absolutely killed it. Her voice melds into the music perfectly, she has her stans who are going to love her no matter what but as a neutral source I can say she doesn't bring the movie down at all and actually brings it up. Cynthia as Elphaba was even more incredible down to the look. Her plight brought me to tears on multiple occasions. You MUST go see it at least once although I will definitely be going a second time, maybe more."", ""The acting's great, the sets and choreography are spectacular, vibrant and full of colour and there are some great songs (in between them belting out notes for no reason), but it's hard to recommend when so much of it is left unfinished. The light plot fells drawn out, mainly focusing on the relationship between the two leads, with other characters barely used and other plot points never really explained. There's some good humour and attempts at defying traditional expectations but I never felt in awe or amazed at the magical world of Oz and the ending, whilst dramatic, felt rushed.\n\nOverall = 6/10."", 'CGI is impressive bringing the land of Oz to life with stunning special effects, costumes, and magical scenery. The Emerald City sparkles, and Elphaba\'s powers are brought to life in mesmerizing ways.\n\nThe movie is predictable and overly long. The story, reframing Elphaba as a misunderstood hero, is predictable, and formulaic, leaning heavily on the tired trope of a mistreated woman seeking justice against ""the man,"" with the Wizard cast as the villain. Big surprise, right? It seems that\'s all Hollywood can manage in most of its makeovers.\n\nThe lack of surprises makes the plot feel repetitive. It\'s so predictable that it\'s one of those movies where you can make a couple of concession stand trips, come back, and not miss anything important. Also, don\'t worry-you\'ll still hear the loud music blaring from the lobby.\n\nThe music, though central to Wicked, becomes overwhelming. Loud, drawn-out ballads dominate the film, slowing the pace and overshadowing the plot. A few standout songs would have been more impactful than the relentless vocal performances. At over two and a half hours, the movie also feels unnecessarily long, dragging in the second half. While visually impressive, Wicked struggles to balance adventure with substance, leaving it more exhausting than magical.', 'Originally, I did NOT want to see this movie. My son begged me to see this film with him and since he\'s performing so well in school, I reluctantly agreed.\n\nI grew up with the original and had zero knowledge and zero interest in the musical production. Later, when I found out the movie was nearly 3 hours long, I almost backed out.\n\nHowever, from the moment it started until the final scene I was captivated and swept away. In fact, there was one scene between the main characters that brought me to tears since it was so moving.\n\nI should also mention that I hate musicals. Actually I despise them! But in this film, the music added to the plot. And the final score: simply unbelievable! While I liked Grande, I loved Cynthia. She stole the movie with her singing. I have never heard of her until this film. She deserves an Academy award for this film.\n\nThe production, the costumes, the sets, the music, the plot, and the acting were all top notch.\n\nBy the time it was all over, I said out loud: ""Wow! Just wow! What an amazing film!"" My reaction got my son off guard because he didn\'t think that I would love it that much.\n\nI also heard other adults from an older generation nearby say, ""That was such a great film!"" I couldn\'t agree more.\n\nIn short, this film is destined to become an instant classic. It will no doubt join the billion dollars club, and rightly so. I can\'t wait until the sequel next year.', 'Loudest audience round of applause that I\'ve heard at the movies since Independence Day, back in 1996; and Wicked part 1 deserved it!\n\nWatching The Wizard of Oz, as a small boy on television every Christmas was a big deal. The wonder it brought to a tiny mind, predating Star Wars, played such a pivotal part in my lifelong love of film. And so, being able to go back to a time of wonder at the cinema, is always just a pure joy. Wicked has the ability to take you back to a simpler time, a time of wonder and amazement. And so from the opening declaration that ""The Witch of the West is Dead"", I was hooked.\n\nJon. M. Chu has delivered something really quite special here, that both fans and newcomers of the book / Broadway sensation will adore. For me, Cynthia Erivo as Elpheba steals the show, but only just from Ariane Grande\'s Glinda, who\'s comedic timing and ""popularity"" is captivating throughout, Another standout is Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero, with his star potential shining through, particularly in one scene, as he dances through life in Shiz University\'s most unique library.\n\nEverything looks and sounds incredible. The outstanding cinematography makes the amazing costume design and live sets (with over 9 million tulip bulbs planted) all pop off the big screen. And the musical numbers do not disappoint; they are all flawless. Every song leads you to a high flying act 1 ending, that simply soars. As Elpheba grabbed her broomstick, and the drums heavy score built to her inevitable flight, I couldn\'t breathe. The poignancy and empowerment of lyrics like ""I\'m through with playing by the rules of someone else\'s game"", ""everyone deserves the chance to fly"" and ""no Wizard that there is or was, is ever gonna bring me down"" hit particularly hard, in this grand finale, in November 2024.\n\nWicked is a breathtaking film, brimming with emotion, fun, commanding vocals and pure imagination. Part 1 is just a good time at the movies, that I recommend seeing on the largest and loudest screen possible. If you have an IMAX nearby, it\'s a must to experience the wonder this motion picture offers. I for one can\'t wait for part 2 next Christmas 💚💚💚💚💚', ""As a fan of Wicked the stage musical for so many years, this film has been a long time coming! Now it's here and just as I hoped, it's absolutely amazing in basically every single way.\n\nIs it too long? A little, yes. And there are still 2 characters that I don't care about/ never did, even in the stage show. BUT... Cynthia and Ariana are amazing as Elphaba and Glinda. I wouldn't be surprised if Ariana got an Oscar nomination for this. The costumes are stunning. The set is phenomenal, with a lot of it being purposely built to avoid CGI being overused.\n\nMusically it's faultless, every actor/actress sounds amazing in their roles and there are barely any changes to the original score. It's not a complete reworked version of every song which is what the Mean Girls movie musical suffered from the most for example.\n\nI think audiences going into this film familiar with The Wizard Of Oz & the Wicked stage show will absolutely love this movie musical! I hope that non musical theatre fans will also find something to love here."", ""I went to see this because my girlfriend is a Wicked fanatic. I've seen OB productions (and I like them) but I'm not a particular fan.\n\nI was expecting to enjoy this film despite myself, but I was blown away. The movie ended and, even after two hours, I was sad it was over. The visuals, practical effects, blocking, dancing, acting and singing were breathtaking.\n\nThis is the best movie adaptation of a musical I have ever seen.\n\nThe film allowed more moments of delicate acting which allowed me to feel the connection between the characters more than I did seeing off broadway productions of Wicked.\n\nYou are missing out on one of the best moviegoing experiences of the decade if you don't see this in a theater.\n\nIt was not perfect. I think Jeff Goldblum was a tonal choice, but his brief singing was a bit out of place. Michelle Yeoh was a great choice but her singing was solid.\n\nHighly recommend!"", ""When I first saw the trailer for this I just thought it was another one of those bleak kiddy musicals with sub par acting. So when the time came for its release I decided to see it. On the way to the theater I joked with my family saying no one get sad or cry at all. I went into this expecting nothing but disappointment. And when the movie ended and I left the theater. I had cried 5 times and was still crying over the ending. This is hands down my new favorite movie of all time and there's no denying it. The acting the cinematography the songs and ELPHBA WAS JUST PERFECT HOLY LORD. Im not one to cry during movies but. If you don't have hope WATCH THIS I BEG OF YOU."", ""My cousin and I agreed last week that this would be today's movie. That said, My mood might have been soured a bit this morning. I hadn't realized it was going to be a two-part movie, with the second half delayed until Thanksgiving next year; the MTA clipped me for $15; and the escalator at the theater was out of order, requiring me to climb a lot of long stairs. That said, there was much to admire and much to complain about in this movie version of the first act of the musical show based upon the first of seven novels by Gregory Maguire. It seems that the Wizard of Oz was a fraud (as anyone who had ever read the original book or seen any movie version would know). Therefore anyone who was against him was a Good Guy, slandered by propaganda, and that means the Wicked Witch of the West, who was anything but.\n\nCall it The Musical Wizard of Oz: The College Years, and that's what you have. The casting is excellent. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are great, both in their performances, and their singing. Michelle Yeoh looks fine with white hair. Jeff Goldblum is excellent as a carny sharpster doing a cold read on Miss Erivo as the wizard. That said, once you accept that Miss Erivo is not the bad guy, but the good guy, everything falls into automatic slots of plots, and the question becomes a matter of wondering when she's going to wake up. For a Broadway show, there's no modulation in the musical numbers. Every song is a big song, with no chance for the audience to catch its emotional breath. Most of the numbers are elaborately choreographed..... and then edited into short clips.\n\nFinally, a kind word for the production design by Nathan Crowley, and the art direction under Ben Collins: it's a mixture of Pre-Raphaelite and Beaux Artes in its look, which is clever, effective, and appropriate for a work that is, ultimately, derived from the Mauve Decade.\n\nIn the end, this is not a Great Movie Musical, because so much about it indicates that Hollywood has forgotten the lessons about the form that it learned in the 1930s and 1940s. Neither do I think that there is a market for movie musicals as a regular genre any more. The style of songs that allowed the audiences to come together over a range of songs that extended from 1890 to 1960 has long ceased to be a living language. Musicals still play on Broadway and perhaps tour, but they are revivals, exercises in nostalgia that have to be rewritten because the original books make no sense to young audiences. I had a good time in the theater, which was packed for a 10AM show with an appreciative audience. So call it good, if not great. We'll have to wait a year to see how it all turns out in what my cousin is calling Game of Thrones: The Musical."", ""I could sit and talk about how amazing everything was, but I want to focus on one thing. Oscars. OSCARS. From the cast to the set, costumes, effects, camerawork, EVERYTHING WAS INCREDIBLE. The crowning jewel of the film was 100% the performance of Ariana and Cynthia. Needless to say they both deserve Oscars. Ariana was destined to play Galinda, and she proved it in this film. She truly just embodied and embraced the role. Cynthia. CYNTHIA. Cynthia is talent. She completely was Elphaba. She gave a performance that showed all the sides of her character. She embraced her smartness, her charm, her whits, and especially her slight craze and sense for justice. If either of them aren't nominated for an Academy Award, I will riot. This movie has changed me for the better."", ""The singing and dancing in Wicked Part 1 were very good, and the opening was captivating, but the pleasure gradually waned as the movie went on, and on ... and on. By the final ten minutes or so I was praying they would stop singing and just wrap it up. I love music and musicals, so this was an unusual reaction on my part.\n\nBefore going to see this, I hadn't realised it was only part 1. That was a bit disappointing. I also never realised the film was so long. Two hours and forty minutes will delight some, but for me, the story and production weren't tight enough to keep me engaged to the end.\n\nFrom this novice's viewpoint, the editing was done with love rather than with a view to creating a tight film. There were many scenes that would have benefitted from some cuts, without losing any of the overall delight."", ""Overall, the film had a talented cast with some good moments. There was a lot of filler though. It was too long for what actually happened. Cynthia's voice was incredible but a couple songs did not fit her, her acting was alright, not particularly outstanding. Ariana had a few good moments towards the beginning and had good comedic timing. Unfortunately her character and acting fell quite flat during the second half and all I could truly focus on was how sick and frail she looked (poor thing). Jonathon Bailey was great, he gave the best performance in my opinion. The acting was fine from everyone but nothing particularly heart throbbing, it felt like acting, but I guess that's to be expected from a broadway adaptation. It was quite disappointing."", 'Absolute delight. From the very first frame, the vibrant, imaginative world of Oz is brought to life with breathtaking visuals and spellbinding effects-particularly during the flying sequences, which are pure magic.\n\nAriana Grande and Cynthia Erivo are brilliant as Glinda and Elphaba. Their performances feel incredibly heartfelt, and their rendition of For Good is nothing short of spine-tingling. The costumes are exquisite, capturing the personality of each character perfectly, while the lavish production design immerses you fully into this fantastical world.\n\nWhat I loved most was how the film explores the deeply emotional themes of friendship, loyalty, and love. The relationship between Glinda and Elphaba is beautifully portrayed, full of nuance and warmth. While the film stays true to the essence of the Broadway musical, it also expands the story in clever ways. The added details and songs make the characters and their world feel even richer.\n\nIn short, Wicked is an absolute must-watch-not just for fans of the stage version, but for anyone who loves a gorgeously crafted fantasy with heart and soul.', 'After hearing a few karaoke songs from Wicked thanks to my theatre friends, I found myself curious about the film. Unfortunately, I had been spoiled on an important plot twist, which was difficult to ignore. However, this knowledge actually allowed me to appreciate the film\'s intricate details much more. Despite not typically being a fan of musicals, I found ""Defying Gravity"" to be deeply moving and shed a few tears as I finally understood the context behind it. Overall, I enjoyed Wicked much more than I had expected. Its unique charm truly captivated me, proving that even non-musical fans can be pleasantly surprised by its magic.', ""Wow. Wicked blew me away. It's everything I hoped for and more-amazing, spellbinding, and downright gorgeous to watch. From the very first note, I was hooked.\n\nThe visuals are out of this world. Every frame feels like a work of art, from the shimmering Emerald City to the darker, more emotional scenes. And the music? Absolute perfection. The vocals are so powerful and raw they gave me chills (and maybe a few tears).\n\nBut it's not just about how it looks and sounds-it's the heart of the story that hits hardest. The friendship, the struggles, the choices-they all feel so real, even in this magical, larger-than-life world.\n\nHonestly, Wicked has set the bar sky-high for movie musicals. It's bold, it's beautiful, and it's unforgettable. 10/10. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for? Go get your socks blown off."", ""Future broadway adaptations need to take note. This was amazing! And amazing is an understatement. The whole cast was excellent, the visuals were very captivating, and it didn't feel too long. The only thing that I was worried about before entering the movie was the length for just his being part 1. But honestly they don't add much to the story from the broadway musical and it still flowed flawlessly. I had no notes when I watched this movie. It was so good and I usually don't like long movies. I would watch again any time given the opportunity. I also feel and heard that people who don't like musicals also enjoyed this film. It has something for everyone. Please go watch this film! Highly recommend."", ""Very done well this movie was amazing. The cast was great the flim its self was beautiful Ariana grade did a fantastic job as Gilda Jeff glodblom Did a great job as the wizard. Cynthia. As elphaba fantastic. The rest of the cast is amazing. The soundtrack Amazing some of the scenes made me cry. I wood what I meant this movie if you're an Ariana Grande fan or if you're a fan of wicked or if you haven't seen it I would highly recommend it. I really enjoy it. I love this movie so much. Can't wait for part two. The costumes. In the movie are beautiful. This movie deserve an Oscar. Over all loved it."", 'As a fan of the musical, this Part 1 spent 160 minutes to show how the director made a long-drawn-out film. I don\'t mind adding the characters from the original book, but it is not an excuse to add many details to the side plot and drag this movie to 160 munites.\n\nWhen it comes to the climax, the most disappointing thing for me is also coming. The famous song Defying Gravity was interrupted in the movie (compared with the musical). When my tears came to my eyes, they were stopped by this interruption.\n\nIt is also a good marketing movie, there are a lot of peripheral products that can be purchased and a lot of online social media events. It made this movie come with a ""popular"" atmosphere, which I love to see.\n\nAll in all, this movie is a good-looking musical movie, literally.', 'I was a bit concerned about the 2 hr. 20 min. Runtime, but it could have been 4 hours and felt like ONE! It was so immersive and fun and harrowing. Like the new Joker movies with Joaquin Phoenix, it puts a spotlight on the *other*, different in ways that causes the bullies to strike out ... and the ""other"" to defend themselves and be called WICKED! Typical ... and makes me seethe. So it explains and shows WHY and how the ""Wicked Witch"" was Born. Everything was spot on, I loved it! I\'ve always wanted to see the Broadway show, but likely won\'t get to. So I am more than thrilled with the movie musical adaptation. Top notch performances which were so full of emotion it is a roller coaster ride I will enjoy for years, maybe decades if I\'m still here. I can not wait for Part 2!', 'Just saw the movie tonight (on the 21st) and I was immediately shocked by the lack of color and contrast. All of the outdoor scenes that should have been spectacular, were so washed out, and the close-up scenes set outdoors had so much permeating bright light behind or around them, that it faded those scenes as well. It even carried over to most of the indoor scenes too. You won\'t be seeing any award nominations for cinematography on this film. It was immediately noticeable and immediately disappointing.\n\nI thought the performances of the two leads were both very good, and each carried just the right tone, with an equal match of talent. I don\'t believe that Jeff Goldblum or Michelle Yeoh brought anything special to the film except for name recognition. Any good actor and actress could have done as good or better in my opinion. Especially Jeff Goldblum, who only knows how to be Jeff Goldblum.\n\nThe best part of a movie adaptation of a stage show or musical is being able to see the close-up acting, and that was thoroughly enjoyable and added to the impact of the story.\n\nI feel that the studio and promotion team did a really good job at covering up the fact that it\'s a two-part movie and that you won\'t get to see the second part for another year. Really deceptive .... disgustingly so. I knew going in, because I am a detail-oriented person.\n\nI don\'t buy the quote that Jon Chu felt there was just ""too much vision"" to fit into one film. What an obvious money grab by the producers and the studio ... Hollywood greed at its worst.\n\nYou can\'t convince me that there wouldn\'t be a big enough audience that would prefer to sit for a 3 1/2 hour-version, to see one completed version of Wicked. If they can\'t do the stage musical justice on screen it in 3 1/2 hours, then forget about it.\n\nI just saw it tonight, and it didn\'t leave me with an ounce of anticipation, for seeing the second half. Especially now knowing just how washed-out the first-half looked.\n\nUnbelievable they couldn\'t come close to the magical Technicolor of the Wizard of Oz from 85 years ago. Guess that was a ""modern, creative decision"".', ""For starters, I have seen the original Broadway Play of Wicked and I really like it. I love Wizard of Oz growing up and I thought it was a good interesting take of the world and setting.\n\nAs a film, I was always curious to see how it would be adapted. While I do appreciate it's faithfulness to the source, there are some good aspects but also not so good. Throughout, the costume designs, the production and the sound designs are amazing. It helps to build the world of Oz and create it's vibe. Including the musical score and singing that offers a vibrate, energized and colorful vibe.\n\nHowever, as a whole, the dull presentation and it's stretched out narrative really seems to fail for me to fully engage with it's power. Writing wise, the narrative is interesting but being stretched out and added with unnecessary characters and moments makes it dried up. Causing some of the characters to be boring and not fully engaging.\n\nThe dialogue is pretty bad and there are some poor noticeable uses of CGI that kills away the magical vibe and feel of Oz. Most of the performances are just fine but they never really wowed me in anything particular. Because as a whole, I feel it's a bit overhyped."", ""To be honest i was just waiting for it because im a fan of ariana and i had never seen wizard of oz or wicked musical before so when i found out she was gonna play galinda i gave it a shot and watched them. Immediately fell in love with the world of oz. I was cursing myself for not becoming a fan of the franchise. Btw Ive always hated musicals i find them too unnatural and cringe so i was expecting some sort of boredom for the musical and dancing parts but god No! Enjoyed it all sooo much. Cynthia played indescribably beautiful and heartfelt. The chemistry and bond between them were outstanding and absolutely phenomenal. Well done 👏 I honestly don't know how im gonna wait another year for part two.""]",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/wicked/7217a2cb-22d2-44ff-a9e2-67f43016ed2b.webp

Excellent re-watch. Highly recommend.', ""Never watched any Argentine/Spanish film before. Actually, the number of foreign language (ie. other than English and Hindi) films I have watched till date is not even two digit. Still, this movie was mind-blowing!! Wild Tales, is a package of 6 short films which are dark and explosive comedies. All of them has the theme of revenge strikingly common and each one of them is unique and funny in its own way. Each one of them puts forth wild yet realistic situations. The first short story is the shortest of them and is shown pre-credits.Its story of a psych who is not even seen on the screen who makes revenge plan which ends on a bang giving us an overly wild ending. The second film slightly more dark and longer, will make you think before deciding what is right and what is wrong. Third one even longer, is my favorite alongside the fourth. Its violent and brutally hilarious with explosive ending(literally). The fourth one sheds light on realistic situation of a common man troubled by the abusive government system. Another explosion in the climax(again literally)! The fifth slightly less on humor quotient but portrays the human characteristic of greed perfectly. Its darker and has a shocking finale! Th last one, longest and wildest of them all will take you to one of the craziest weddings you have ever seen. Beneath its madness it subtly touches upon the issues of trust and betrayals in human relations.\n\nBesides the common notion of revenge and letting oneself lose control in rage, all these tales also focus on how tiniest of our actions can lead to monstrous consequences. The comedy is satirical and dark still its outright hilarious in many scenes. There are many actors (each story has different cast), can't highlight anyone as most of them have done a good job. Director Damian Szifron executes all the ridiculous madness and explosive twists with sheer brilliance leaving dazed at the end of each story. The soundtrack is also quirky and beautiful.The two hours fly away like a breeze. Even if you don't understand the language you will be so invested that after sometime you won't even realize that you are watching a Non- English film. Highly enjoyable!\n\nRATING: [4/5]"", 'Perhaps the best omnibus dark comedy ever made. This movie is funny, it explores some of the darker parts of humanity but it does so with so much wit and intelligence. It was a great hit in South America, and understandably so. Despite dark and cynical take on the human condition, the movie is lighthearted and highly watchable, and uncompromisingly original.', 'Watched last night at the theater with my girlfriend.\n\nIt\'s a compilations of 6 tales, but they don\'t have the same type of lenght, humor or darkness. Each one is unique.\n\n1) Airplane tale: fantastic, hilarating and surrealistic story to open the series.\n\n2) Coffee shop tale: shorter, but dark and makes you wonder what\'s ""freedom"" for some people.\n\n3) Road tale: excellent. A really LOT of violence and a little bit of humor makes this one of the best tales in the movie.\n\n4) Human limit tale: a man that\'s having a couple of really bad days explode when he runs out of patiente. Great acting.\n\n5) Accident tale: 90% darkness. And the fact that could be a very possible story makes it even darker. Shocking finale.\n\n6) Wedding tale: almost impossible to qualify. Hilarious for the most part, but at the end, it will make you wonder to whom you are spending your whole life with.\n\nSeeing this compilation in a theater for the price of one, its a damn good deal if you ask me.\n\nGo watch it.', ""The movie is actually 6 short films, all related by brutal violence motivated by different situations. Family. Society. Government. It works very well like that, lasting over 120 minutes that go by quickly. It feels very fluid. Szifrón's eye is very precise. You can tell everything was very well thought. I wouldn't say this is a philosophical film, but it is clever entertainment, that makes you think if this wild tales are actually that wild... Even though this stories are taken to the extreme, everything feels somehow possible when you look back.\n\nDarkly humorous. Watch it."", ""This Argentine film that found itself nominated for the 2014 Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award comes to us from director Damián Szifrón who has crafted a feature film comprised of a series of 6 vignettes/small stories about human beings from all walks of (Argentine) life who are all tested and taken to their limits ... until they finally lose control. While mostly disastrous the film is also WILDly thrilling and wholly original in its daring cheekiness ... as the film is a bitter dark comedy (with tinges of brutal drama).\n\nIt is a film about a myriad group of people on a plane; a young waitress who still finds herself grieving over a family tragedy of the past; an encounter between two men from different social classes on a desolate highway; a man growing tired of the rat race of life in which we are all destined to lose; the aftermath of a horrible automobile accident; and a wedding reception like none you've ever seen before. All feature one or two characters taken to the edge ...\n\nIt is how each of them handles their various situations that give us our WILD stories. Fascinatingly grim at times, the film almost always miraculously produces laughter and grins. Much of the laughter might be heavily muffled as one chuckles under his/her breath as others around them fail to see the director's (WILDly) wicked sense of humor come into play in some of the film's intense situations; but the dark tone pervades the entire film.\n\nWhile the film is most definitely tragic in many instances, Wild Tales is a comedy of errors about human nature and who we are. Some can watch this and most-likely not pick up even a hint of humor; but it is there ... and it is fantastically facetious.\n\nWildly thrilling. Wildly fun. Wildly original. It is courageously wild."", 'I went to see this movie hoping to get a brake from Hollywood production. And I did. It was amazing, one of the best movies I\'ve seen on big screen in 2 or 3 years.\n\nPlot consists of different stories which all have one thing in common: they are about revenge. Every single story starts rather boring. At the very beginning I was thinking ""What\'s so wild about it? It is just lame"" and by the end of the intro I was like ""Holy God! No, they did not just twist it like that! OMG!""\n\nAnd it gets better. A true masterpiece. I am from Russia so for me it was rather interesting and surprising that Latin America is so similar to Russia. The views, the behaviour of the people, the insanity - all like at home.\n\nYou won\'t regret seeing this movie. Don\'t take your kid or your grandmother though.', 'i always thought that the real art is missing these days, the cinema is going on the wrong side, this movie was the hope, that there is still genius artist who can makes such a beautiful story, with excellence in direction and perfection in casting, this is the best movie i ever watched so far, it is black comedy and it is REAL, it is like what you think you DO, what you imagine COMES REAL, it is HUMAN, for those who really loves the art of cinema, MUST MUST MUST watch this movie, you will enjoy it from the beginning to the cast list, it is a THEATER in a cinema movie, 10/10 and we will wait a lot to see such a quality movie like this one.', ""There will be times within us all when rage surrounds, when the urge to lash and kick the world compounds, when the consequence goes missing, and you're left distraught and wishing, that you hadn't set that foot outside the bounds. This result will more than likely cost you dear, as you cascade, crush, curtail all your fears, when adrenaline explodes, hackles raised you're on your toes, seeing red - but there is nothing else that's clear. As the dust begins to settle consequences, of your actions may reveal extreme expenses, incarceration in a place, after losing more than face, reputation and your life now in cessation."", 'This is a very watchable and often extremely funny anthology of six short films. The dialogue is in Spanish, the director and settings are Argentine. The stories are all slightly-over-the-top-realism in the manner of Almodóvar tinged with the dark surrealism of the Buñuel of The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. The scenarios are graphic rather than subtle, but they all work well most of the time, because most of us can identify with the main characters, recognizing how little it can take to shake us from complacency into violence.\n\nThe official English title ""Wild Tales"" suggests madcap craziness. But these tales are savage (""selvaje"" in the original Spanish), a word that better suggests the ferocious beast lurking not far under the skin of all of us. The beast can be unchained by nothing more complicated than being cut off by a driver who doesn\'t signal or finding that our car has been impounded for an unwitting parking infraction.\n\nIn the first and shortest episode, what appears to be an absurd series of coincidences linking all the passengers on a plane turns out to have a logical and sinister rationale. The ending explains why in the opening scene the woman checking in at the airport is told that she will not earn frequent flyer points for her trip! And the final, longest episode hilariously tracks the chaotic degeneration of a stereotypical Jewish wedding party, initiated by the bride\'s discovery that the groom has been cheating on her with one of the guests. This is not a film for young children or for people who aren\'t willing to admit how close they sometimes are to dissolving in animal rage.', ""Hopefully Damián Szifron is on his way to Hollywood. Simply the most refreshing and entertaining film that I've been lucky enough to watch since Nightcrawler...really it's that good. The darkest comedy you'll have the pleasure to experience. Ticks all the boxes, cinematic, a superb ensemble cast deliver in every short story, dead pan humour, intelligent, thought provoking, terrifyingly realistic, wonderful camera-work especially in the final story, with a couple of explosions and some (thankfully) subtle CGI thrown in to complete this masterpiece. Lovely to once again sit amid an audience all happily laughing out loud, without the need to lower itself to racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic humour, though the scatological humour is surprisingly perfectly appropriate and carefully framed to make the point without unnecessary vulgarity. Ten out of Ten. A new name to watch. Kudos to Damián Szifron."", '""Relatos Salvajes"" is a black comedy film divided in six segments.\n\n(1) ""Pasternak"": one model and a music critic in a plane find that they have a common acquaintance called Pasternak. Soon they discover that every passenger and crew on board know Pasternak. Cosmic coincidence?\n\n(2) ""The Rats"": a waitress of a diner recognizes her client as the loan shark that caused a tragedy in her family. The cook suggests mixing rat poison in his food, but she refuses. But the cook decides to proceed in her plan. When his son arrives, the waitress tries to fix the situation.\n\n(3) ""The Strongest"": Two drivers on a lone highway have an argument with tragic consequences.\n\n(4) ""Little Bomb"": The demolition engineer has his car towed by a truck for parking in a wrong place and he has an argument with the employee of the towing company. This event destroys his private and professional life, and he plots revenge against the corrupt towing company and the City Hall.\n\n(5) ""The Proposal"": The reckless hit-and-run son of a wealthy family hits and kills a pregnant woman. He wakes up his parents and his father calls the lawyer. They propose to pay the groundkeeper to take the blame. Soon the father discovers that he is victim of extortion of his lawyer and the detective in charge of the investigation. What will be his decision?\n\n(6) ""Until Death Do Us Apart"": During the wedding party, the wife discovers that her husband has cheated her with one of the guests and decides to payback.\n\n""Relatos Salvajes"" is an insane and funny comedy, with great critic to the corruption of the public services in Argentina (but could be in most of the South American countries); to the corrupt elite and police; to the lack of justice. It is hard to choose the best segment. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): ""Relatos Selvagens"" (""Wild Reports"")', ""This film isn't deserving of the excess of praise it has been lauded with. It's entertaining, thought provoking at times, but not by a long mile, a master piece.\n\nThe third short is the most exciting. I would have much preferred this story to have been a main feature length road movie. It captures beautifully the lush landscapes of Argentina, underscored by an 80s Giorgio Moroder music soundtrack. Leonardo Sbraglia is excellent in the lead and so is the insane brute, hot on his heels.\n\nBy the end of this third short however, the film has climaxed. And there's still more than 1,5 hours to follow. How is that time going to be filled?\n\nMore shorts follow where the corruption of humans is exposed and offset against pitch black humour. They are criticisms against sick modern day over-bureaucratic societies, in this case Argentina (but it could be transposed to most other parts of the world). It shows how people create hell for each other; and how some puncture that infernal catch 22 to cathartic effect. It does a decent enough job at it.\n\nThe 6th and last short film is a relentless frenzy of noise and visual chaos, and fittingly so, the story is also a convoluted mess. Unfortunately this short is the longest of them all. It makes the entire film end on a bum note for me. Annihilating all the goodwill, the director had garnered from me up until then.\n\nIt made me realise that at no single point during any of the shorts, had I been emotionally touched, nor did I have a moment of intellectual revelation. The film is made up of smoke and mirrors, hiding the fact that there's no heart in the film. Nor is it a product of a great mind; just some half-finished ideas strung together to add up to the duration of one long feature. It's simply one of those movies that a certain public must see and talk highly of, because it's a case of the Emperor's new clothes, really."", 'Greetings again from the darkness. Do you often get accused of having a slightly demented sense of humor? Do you have secret crazy thoughts of seeking revenge on those who have wronged you? If so, writer/director Damian Szifron has a collection of short stories just for you!\n\nNominated for Best Foreign Language Oscar, Argentina\'s entry is just now opening in the Dallas market where I live. To say Wild Tales is a wild ride would be quite an understatement. There are six short stories blended together, and while you may not recognize the theme immediately, it doesn\'t take long before rage and retribution jump to the forefront in these seemingly typical slices of everyday life.\n\nThe best short stories make a quick grab for attention, and manage to convey character and setting from the beginning. The writing is crucial and can easily collapse in the hands of a less-proficient short story writer. But when it works, it\'s fascinating to watch, and Mr. Szifron has a real talent for making us laugh in the midst of truly awful situations.\n\nNot to give away any details, but the six stories involve: a remarkable ""coincidence"" on a flight, an unwelcome customer at a local diner, a close-quarters brawl at a bridge, the frustration of dealing with ""the system"", misguided parental instincts in protecting their kid, and the most wheels-off wedding reception ever filmed.\n\nIf you are ever searching for an example of a dark comedy, this one will provide clarity. The seemingly unrelated stories are woven together through payback, though the price is often pretty high. Mr. Szifron\'s stories remind us that life is not fair, but when it\'s happening to someone else, we can still laugh about it.', ""I had an idea from the opening credits that Damian Szifron's WILD TALES, was going to be fun. Images of animals with the actors' names as counterpart, preparing the audience for the animalistic behavior about to come.\n\nThe film is comprised of six separate vignettes, short stories, if you will. These vignettes all begin innocently enough, passengers boarding a plane, a man driving through the desert, a restaurant on a stormy night, a wedding, everyday slices of modern day life. Something occurs to break the routine, the main character responds, then the scene escalates, and escalates, and when you think you've reached the peak, it escalates even more, and finally in the end reaches a perfect balance of comedy and tragedy. The tales are all perfectly relatable and escalate logically and realistically, nothing comes out from left field. All the characters, each flawed in so many ways, remind us so much of ourselves, both at our best and at our worst... and make us laugh and feel in recognition.\n\nGreat Movie."", '6 Stories - 6 masterpieces!

The utmost fantasies fulfilled, the extremes of emotions, and the riot of laughter that engulfed me from all sides, I cannot remember having such a good time watching a film.

That one and this one suggest to me that Argentina has a vibrant film industry, and I would like very much to see more movies from there, a pronounced advancement from the Dirty War (the Kirchner and Fernandez presidencies probably helped). The hilarious satire that is ""Wild Tales"" deserves every award that it\'s won. I highly recommend it.', ""This Argentinian movie was released in my country (Chile) on last Thursday, and since i heard very good comments about the movie i decided to go to a Cinema at Parque Arauco in Chile and this is what i wrote about it:\n\nThe film is split into six unconnected stories, watching each story is around 20-30 minutes long and you feel like you're watching a live action short film. What do they have in common? All of them are a mix between drama and comedy. The script is hilarious, even if the lines are sad, it's so full of black comedy, that there were people rolling on the floor laughing at the Cinema.\n\nI'd write much more about this film, but i think i might be spoiling it, so i prefer to tell you that i can't wait to watch it again. So please do NOT miss it."", 'This is my first Argentine movie and I am blown away.\n\nWith an amazing opening sequence, Wild Tales is a collection of six short, unrelated live action tales that depict human nature in its purest form. The stories speak volumes about the types of lives we all live. A conversation at the beginning turns into a startling revelation at the end of the first short, which is as great as the remaining five. However, the final short is slightly dull compared to what the first five have to offer.\n\nBlack comedy is the perfect genre this would fall in because the short tales are about ordinary people finding themselves in ordinary situations. The only factor that distinguishes it from the rest is that it goes ahead turning the ordinary into something wicked and super. It is a mix of drama and quirkiness that we all are accustomed to. And the best part is that the stories are to the point.\n\nDefinitely the film is for people who have an eye for humor and cinematic art. You will love and cherish this and yearn to re-watch it. Excellent photography, backed by good writing and appropriate music. The score is so supportive, one awaits it in the screenplay. With some great performances and direction, Wild Tales is an appealing drama which will appeal even if you do not understand Spanish.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Wild Tales is a masterpiece and once you watch it, you will be asking your friends to watch it just so you can discuss it with them. 9/10 - brilliant!\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES', ""This is an excellent piece that will entertain you from the very first second to the last. I am looking forward to seeing this movie again with someone that would appreciate it. While it is completely in Argentine Spanish (which is great for me as I am a fluent Spanish-speaker) it has subtitles which are excellent. The combination of acting and story are truly magnificent. Comparing this movie to a Tarantino film is inaccurate, however, this is better than Tarantino. Tarantino's films are mostly satirical. There is no satire in this movie."", 'It\'s hard to review an unconventional movie, because this one is sort of six movies all in one. Relatos Salvajes (Wild Tales) is about six different and independent stories with one thing in common: the limit of our patience, or like it\'s tagline says...""All may lose control"". Ordinary people that find themselves in awkward situations they didn\'t look for, and that\'s the beauty of this movie. It\'s almost impossible not to feel identified with one of the characters, with one of their situations, despite the awkward moments they struggle that in some passages make us feel uncomfortable. And the merit of director Damián Szifrón is to tell those stories with an exquisite combination of intrigue, suspense and a remarkable and effective dark humor. The acting, editing, photography and the music of Gustavo Santaolalla are all ingredients that give extra points. You\'ll get out of the cinema talking to each other which tale you enjoyed the most and reviewing some of their hilarious scenes.', 'Yes, it is, indeed. It has it all: an Agatha Christie-style intrigue, peripeteia, remarkable dark humor, and psychological drama. This segment is so perfect that no continuation is really necessary, and the film should have ended with the last scene of Pasternak. Regrettably, it does not, and the remaining five shorts are no match to Pasternak, the last two parts being excessively long and merely intended to help the director to come up with a full-length feature. Nonetheless, the beauty of Pasternak justifies a solid 7.', '""Wild Tales"" (2014 release from Argentina; 122 min.) is a collection of 6 seemingly unrelated tales which all bear the same theme: revenge. The opening (pre-movie credits) tale is a classic: a woman strikes up a conversation with another airplane passenger and they find out that by complete coincidence (or not?) they are both acquainted with the same person. Then it emerges that several other passengers also know that person... No worries, I\'m not going to spoil anything. This first (and short) story sets the mood for the movie perfectly, as we get five more vignettes that are all one better than the other. I can\'t decide which is my favorite, to be honest.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest movie from Argentine writer-director Damian Szifron, and what a beauty he delivers with this movie. When I say ""beauty"", I certainly don\'t mean it in a sugary way, as in fact Szifron\'s film can be seen as a brutal assessment of the human condition. Check out the tale of the driver who gets tangled up with a \'left lane bandit\' only then to suffer a flat tire and suffer the consequences... Or, even worse (should I say better?), check out the tale of the frustrated guy whose car gets towed without reason (according to the guy, of course), and wants to file a complaint... (this story reminded me of that Michael Douglas film ""Falling Down""). The movie is also a blistering indictment of Argentina\'s judicial system (check out the story where a well-off family\'s son kills a pregnant woman in a hit-and-run). The very last story (about a wedding reception that goes horribly wrong) is also the longest (close to 30 min.), and capsules the movie\'s spirit perfectly. It is no wonder that ""Wild Tales"" was a nominee for Best Foreign Language Movies at this year\'s Oscars. I\'ve now seen 4 of the 5 nominated films and honestly they are all worthy in their own right, and then some.\n\n""Wild Tales"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn\'t wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not super, which is a shame. I had high expectations for ""Wild Tales"" and they were met, and then some. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Wild Tales"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!', 'I did not expect much of the Wild Tales, I just wanted it to see because it is on the 250 movies list. After watching it I now clearly see why it is on that place. Wild Tales is a brilliant movie featuring not one but several fabtastic mini stories that all have in common that they do not get boring, always entertain you and sometimes even teach you something for life.\n\nThe 2 hours were the best teo hours of my day and I will not forget this movie ever again. This is a clear recimmendation to all of you! You have never seen such a movie before, I promise! Enjoy the wild ride, it is something you only experience once in your life!', 'You want to laugh at our rage against self-serving institutions? You want to chuckle at road rage gone scatological? How about the gigantic marriage ceremony gone bad? These three tales and three macabre more form the nucleus of a dark comedy from Damian Szifron unlike any you have ever seen.\n\nWild Tales, produced by Pedro Almadovar, is a violent burlesque about our obsessions and our tempers lightened with our comically absurd attitudes toward societal imperatives and institutions over which we have little control. Although set in Argentina, the frustrations are universal.\n\nHow many of us have seethed at seeing our cars have been hauled away for illegal (or not) parking. In a rare case when we are right, the bureaucracy will test us in the extreme to prove our innocence. As in a short story here, not all of us have the explosive resources to get back at the impersonal forces.\n\nAlthough Wild Tales (an appropriate title given the bizarre tales) makes light of the frustrations of modern living, the first episode depicting the strange coincidences of airline passengers\' intersecting lives is so apropos for today\'s Lufthansa tragedy as to leave you breathless. You\'ll know my reference when you see the film.\n\nAnd see it you must if you haven\'t had some good laughs recently with so-called romantic comedies. Although one or two of the tales are not as mirthful as the others (the wealthy family involved in paying bribes is dull and long ), make no mistake, writer-director Szifron, will exact a measure of unease as you recognize your secret attitudes about gender and class in these six ""wild tales.""', ""It consists of several micro stories, I think they are 4-5 They tell stories of people losing control and like those losses of control, can cause either prison, death and other things.\n\nPhilosophical dilemmas of everyday life, But nothing great, It's pretty well done, But it's Poor in terms of content innovation, One expected more and ended up seeing something very basic. Too Overrated"", ""Excellent assortment of edgy, original and enthralling short stories.\n\nSix short stories, all written and directed by Damián Szifrón. The stories are not connected at all and cover various subjects and characters. However, they are all incredibly interesting and engaging. Some have a great moral to them, some have great twists and some are just about a good, succinct story.\n\nIt is actually quite amazing how much character depth and plot development Szifrón crams into each 15-20 minute story.\n\nThe sharp, edgy plots and solid direction are aided by a cast that doesn't put a foot wrong.\n\nGoes to show you don't need 90+ minutes to tell a good tale. For the same time you can get six!"", 'Being a horror and thriller fan, this movie was very interesting.\n\nStories of revenge one after the other will keep you on the edge of your seat! And the stories told are short. Filled with suspense. You will not know what is going to happen next. And the stories will seem so real.\n\nStories of day to day anger and real life occurrences. The actors are very convincing in their roles. Pace of the short stories is very gripping.\n\nSome of the shots captured are amazing. Overall very thrilling! And a must watch!', 'Splendid and well crafted.A slightly radical film, this is a collection of six equally good short stories of different people from director Damian Scifron and producer Pedro Almodovar. Engaging throughout and entire film; well shot and performed with convivial dialogue. Thoroughly dramatic as well as humorous this film will keep you excited throughout, no doubt. An interesting blend of characters as well. To be able to create six funny, intense and ironic stories and combine them in one is really the work of a master director. A well chosen cast tops off this terrific comedy drama. Evidently one of the better films of 2015 so far A must see! Solid and comfortable 9.', 'The movie definitely paid homage quite well to Pedro Almodovar who produced this, he is the master of absurdist anger and chaos and this director made a case for himself as somebody who can carry that torch. If you enjoy sharp social critiques about what drives us crazy in modern society, this is for you. There was also some not very subtle swipes at the upper classes and some commentary about how corruption is so normalized in Argentinian society. Despite being bleak, the movie was visually appealing and had a great soundtrack that did not overwhelm. You will find yourself laughing at some things you hope nobody else notices.\n\nEverybody can debate about which of the stories is their personal favorite. There is a little something for everybody. I liked Gabriel Pasternak, the vengeful engineer, and the wedding from hell best but all of the stories were good. I am not overly familiar with Argentinian cinema, I did recognize one of the actors from ""The Secret in Their Eyes,"" it makes me want delve more into the movies of that country. I can see why it was popular there and hopefully it gets the attention it deserves here in the United States.', ""More story por favor :) So there are 6 epic stories in this movie.\n\nRemember the Vengeance trilogy, the story is kinda like that but it is shorter and it has lot dark comedy in it.\n\nI love that the first three stories have short build up without delaying the excitement. I think it's just hilarious.\n\nI kinda hate the fourth story I think it is the weakest link, I would rate it six.\n\nThe fifth story is kinda weak too.\n\nThe last story is bit different than the rest, but is the most hilarious. It is about marriage and love but with dark comedy in it, something refreshing so just watch it.\n\nOverall it's quite refreshing, this is one of non-English movie that you don't wanna miss."", 'There is much to praise about ""Relatos Salvajes"", and some in less extent to criticize. The positive in this episodic weaving of tales has most likely been said and repeated: stories are engrossing, ultimately effective in their message and of brutal pace and delivery. But what subtracts the movie of it\'s peak is the format. Granted, the format IS the movie; but we\'ve seen coral stories work much better with the thematic cord weaving it into one common paste without abrupt cuts (Crash, Pulp Fiction). The division of short stories can be as rewarding as it is conflicting: some stories are better than others (which ones are subjective to the viewer, you). This results in a roller coaster in which one cannot settle comfortably. The better stories need more time and the worst ones have too much of it.\n\nIn my case, I thought the wedding one was too much, and the airplane too little. Almost certainly this unevenness will compute to other viewers with their own particular tastes, who will prefer the whole over the parts if they adore it and divide the parts from the whole if they didn\'t. Although there is a common subject, and it is quite evident; I felt displaced when a story ended and another began. Unfilled. They weren\'t all in the same quality league (acting, pace, themes) and as such it felt like puzzle pieces some too big and some too small.\n\nThe whole is approved, no doubt. It all depends if you want the main course or six appetizers to go. I felt a little hungry after leaving, but I could go back to the restaurant again.', ""Wild Tales is the best film I have seen in a long time. The script is so clever and unique that is a must see for movies lovers. What is the border between tolerance and barbarism? We can all loose control in just one second even in the most ordinary situations. Action lovers will enjoy the ride more than romantic audiences since revenge is at the center of this master piece. In my opinion, this is the best Argentine Film in decades and a box office record in Latin America and Spain. Even Almodovar brothers are the producers the film has a unique style that is not crazy but real. Get ready for a different kind of movie that will take you out of your seat and even we shouldn't laugh about it ...well I can guarantee that you will. Clever mixed of comedy and drama that will make you think again and again and even change behaviors after you give it a thought. If Wild Tales doesn't get the Oscar for Best Foreign Film I might wonder who will."", 'I recently watched the 2014 Spanish film ""Wild Tales"", which vividly depicted various episodes of vengeful violence. The movie showcased bloodthirsty, brutal, and senseless acts of revenge, prompting reflection on the darker aspects of human nature. It left me pondering the possibility of a significantly better world if humanity embraced more kindness. The film skillfully navigated through intense scenarios, inviting the audience to contemplate the consequences of unchecked vengeance. In a world filled with such narratives, the call for compassion becomes even more urgent.\n\nUnleashing the Savage Realities of Vengeful Retribution.', ""Downright hilarious, incessantly fun & delightfully deranged, Wild Tales is one of the finest black comedies to surface on the silver screen in recent years and is a cleverly structured, ingeniously executed & expertly narrated anthology of six standalone shorts, each oozing with heavy dose of creativity, wickedness & macabre use of humour that, despite featuring different stories, forms a consistently thrilling whole and remains a highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly satisfying ride from the very beginning to the very end.\n\nWild Tales (also known as Relatos Salvajes) is told in six segments. First follows a group of people on a plane who discover that they all have a common acquaintance. Second follows a waitress who recognises her client and the tragedy he caused in her life. Third concerns two drivers whose argument ends with tragic consequences. Fourth follows a demolition expert whose life is destroyed by a car towing incident. Fifth is about a wealthy family whose son has an overnight hit-n- run accident, and the sixth is centred around a wedding party in which the bride just finds out about her husband's infidelity.\n\nWritten & directed by Damián Szifron, all the six stories within Wild Tales are connected by a common theme of violence & vengeance but the morbid wit of it makes sure that it never becomes too serious. All the tales are captivating & strong enough to stand on its own, all the characters are brilliantly penned down plus the actors do a terrific job in bringing them to life, Szifron's screenplay is as impressive as his quality direction, and each tale packs in highly believable scenarios, thus making it more effective. For me, every subsequent short was better than the one preceding it and the film as a whole never for once feels dull.\n\nThe technical aspects make sure that all the stories exhibit the same feel & texture in order to maintain a consistent tone throughout its runtime. Cinematography binds it all the stories together with nearly similar camera-work & colour composition in all six stories, and all sets are brightly light. Its 122 minutes of runtime is steadily paced and every segment is tightly wrapped. A dark, sinister ambiance encapsulates the whole film at all times and the tense vibe is effectively sustained. Music plays a vital role in balancing the whole act and Gustavo Santaolalla's exquisite score does exactly that, in addition to some cool selection of songs.\n\nComing to the performances, every cast member does a fantastic job in their given roles & the sum of the parts is always greater than any individual contribution. The leading actors in each segment carry that story amazingly well and even the ones chipping in with supporting work are no slouch. The acting ranges from thoroughly restrained to totally maniacal but all of their inputs are in tune with the narrative these characters are confined to. Ricardo Darín is one of the best highlights but the film saves its best for the last, where the duo playing a newly wed couple take the stage in a calm, fashioned manner but turn absolutely deranged to finish the film on a memorable high.\n\nOn an overall scale, Wild Tales is a pleasant surprise for I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it turned out to be. It's a wild, crazy & demented experience that delivers the thrills in the most unexpected ways and is finely balanced & accomplished in both storytelling as well as technical aspects. It's smart, it's creative & it offers plenty of laughs plus every tale has got something that makes them stand out in one way or another. It doesn't happen very often in cinema when every short in an anthology movie leaves a positive impression and while the quality differs from story to story here, each segment well above the line of mediocrity. An instant classic, one of the best films of its year & definitely amongst the finest examples of its genre, this dark, uproarious & subversive satire from Argentina comes very highly recommended."", ""The car scene in Pulp Fiction could be described as black comedy, but this movie is just dark aggression, violence and not much else. At least in the first three scenes I saw before I stopped watching. I do not understand why this has the tag 'comedy' as there is nothing funny at all about the dark violence in this film. Only a sick mind could describe it as funny. That aside, the film is well made, everything is very realistic. But it's absolutely not a comedy, hence my low rating."", ""If ordinary films are like novels, this one is like an exquisite collection of short stories. The film is divided into six segments, each with its own plot and character development. Director Damian Szifron is like a modern-day Guy de Maupassant, telling each story with meticulous accuracy, carefully measuring out each twist, detail and conversation.\n\nThe segments are hilarious and over the top, but at the same time satirical and somehow realistic - the extreme events could happen to any of us. That's why this is such a great film: its shows the darkest side of human nature and of Argentinian society, but in such a way that it makes you smile.\n\nThe director claims the theme connecting the stories is 'the joy of losing control'. It's also the tag-line of the movie: 'We can all lose control'. Indeed, most of the segments are about losing control, although one is about keeping everything under control in a situation that can easily spin out of control. In any case, all segments are about individuals solving a conflict in an extreme way. In most segments, the solution is extremely violent or deadly.\n\nAlthough the trailer splashes out the name 'Almodovar' because Pedro and his brother produced the film, the style is by no means Almodovar-like. Szafron uses a sophisticated style, very different from the extreme cinematography we know from Almodovar. 'Relatos Salvajes' also surprises with original cinematographic gimmicks. In one scene, the camera is positioned in an overhead bin of an airplane. In another, in the interior of an ATM, with the image filmed through the touch screen. The film is carefully constructed, with lots of little details. In one segment, about a man fighting the parking ticket bureaucracy in his city, we see the conspicuous towing trucks constantly moving through the image, as a sort of evil force.\n\nOnce again, an Argentinian film maker pleasantly surprises moviegoers around the world. Maybe such wonderful, sharp-edged movies can only flourish in a country like Argentina, where life is a bit of a struggle and not everything is taken for granted"", 'Mixing modern rage with black comedy this collection of shorts rises above expectations to become one of the best and funniest movies from Argentina along with The Secret In Their Eyes and El Aura, and probably the most accessible for international audiences\n\nSix unrelated stories that share a common theme of revenge are shown back to back, and not edited back and forward like it\'s usual with these kind of movie, some of them are better than others: the opener, the road rage incident, the hit and run, and the wedding stand out, while the more conventional and predictable ""Bombita"" and ""The Rats"" still entertain thanks to superb writing and directing\n\nThere\'s a few annoying problems with logical plot holes like why would the rich yuppie go out of his way to put the damaged spare tired in his trunk (and thus leaving it open) when running for his life and factual errors like on the wedding episode the bride\'s threats about this husband\'s companies are meaningless because in Argentina possessions are considered marriage goods (""bienes gananciales"") only if the are acquire during the marriage and not before like the screen husband\'s companies, and like these are others but among such high quality stuff glaring mistakes like these are more evident\n\nhighly recommended', 'I went in this completely unprepared (as I like to do in general) having not read a single thing. I recognized one of the actors on the poster and have generally watched a couple of Spanish language movies that knew how to hit the spot (if that makes sense to you). What I mean is: They know how to make a good movie. And while some might argue that in this case ""movie"" would be an understatement, the whole thing is crazy and every bit of it is great to watch.\n\nThe beginning alone will or might catch you off-guard. It starts off slow, but once you get the drift of it (no pun intended) you know what this will be about. And it still is able to surprise you. What is not to love here? Well if you are not in the mood or generally don\'t like that darker touch of humor, you obviously won\'t be amused or entertained for that matter. For everyone else: Cherish and dig in!

She opened an orphanage and faced so much adversity all along the way. We need young woman to have someone like this woman to look up to, she was able to take all the ridicule and hate she got and become greater than she ever had the right to become. That's amazing! But what's even more amazing to me is that it's a true story."", ""My Review - Cabrini My Rating 8/10 In Cinemas now I was a little surprised at how much I enjoyed Cabrini I was thinking it might be full of Catholic dogma but it's not.\n\nIn fact some of the greatest obstacles that Frances Cabrini the first United States citizen to have been canonized a saint by the Catholic Church came from the male dominated church hierarchy from the Cardinals to the Pope.\n\nIt's an amazing story of an Italian woman's strength and faith to help orphan children while battling ethnic and gender discrimination .\n\nThese hungry Italian orphan children whose parents have died of disease live less of a life than the rats that infest The Five Points a 19th century neighbourhood in Lower Manhattan New York .\n\nThey are forced to seek warmth and shelter in the underground steam pipes at night.\n\nMaria Francesca Cabrini and the Italian nuns that have followed her to New York eventually open an orphanage much to the displeasure of New York Mayor Gould played by John Lithgow .\n\nArchbishop Corrigan of New York played by David Morse place obstacles in the nuns way not wanting to anger the Mayor or the affluent citizens that see the Italians as scum or wops as they called them.\n\nThe Archbishop eventually helps Cabrini find a home for her charges when she and the orphans are evicted from the fashionable district they rent premises in an effort to keep her quiet.\n\nHowever as Cabrin's health and strength decline due to a post TB condition she meets more obstacles when attempting to open a desperately needed hospital after a devastating factory explosion kills many immigrant adults and children.\n\nCabrini is skilfully directed by Mexican director Alejandro Gomez Monteverde who also directed the superb 2023 docu drama Sound of Freedom.\n\nCristiana Dell'Anna is an Italian actress who I haven't seen before she is wonderful in the role of Sister Cabrini . This is one of those demanding emotional performances that takes a very talented actress to excel in.\n\nOf course there are other impressive supporting performances I mentioned John Lithgow and David Morse another standout is Romana Maggiora Vergano who plays Vittoria a young prostitute Cabrini brings into her fold who turns out to be her greatest supporter when the nun is at her lowest ebb.\n\nI can recommend Cabrini it tells a little known inspirational story of a woman who despite chronic ill health and broken English uses her entrepreneurial mind to build an empire of hope unlike anything the world had ever seen.\n\nI did think the film score was a bit over the top and over sentimental at times written by Gene Back there were moments which reminded me of Wagner's orchestral fantasies but it's effective and doesn't intrude on the movie.\n\nThere's a treat for opera fans also in Cabrini with Rolando Villazón cast as a famous opera singer in Cabrini's orbit plus a brand new song titled Dare to Be from Andrea Bocelli, sung with his daughter Virginia.\n\nAmazingly the real Frances Xavier Cabrini lived till she was 67 years old despite being told she had 3 years to live in her late thirties she was canonised as a Saint in the Catholic church in July 1946 becoming the first American citizen to be proclaimed a Saint."", ""I'm not religious in any way shape or form, but I really liked this movie.\n\nThe sets and the acting were all top notch...watching this made me wonder how Hollywood movies are so expensive, because this looked better than alot of 100 million dollar + movies that I have seen.\n\nIt's a great story about someone who simply wants to help other by any means. She's a bulldog and does what she needs to in order to get the job done.\n\nThe entire story has religious undertones but it is very much not in your face.

Historically I felt enriched, but also I felt an overwhelming empathy for my fellow man and the struggles people are going through.

Both films have the same director, Alejandro Monteverde.\n\nThe realism and the goodness of the characters helps make the two films memorable for putting us directly in the action (in Cabrini 1899 New York City) and only subtly sanctifying the heroes. The elements of first-rate filming are in Cabrini: original music by Gene Back that captures spirituality while exalting humanity, Alisha Silverstein\'s spot-on period costumes, and an equally-impressive Carlos-Lagunas production design. Over them all is a lean and effective story by Monteverde and Rod Barr aided immensely by the creative editing of Brian Scofield.\n\nAs always, the acting makes the difference: Besides Dell\'Anna\'s award-worthy interpretation of the diminutive ""entrepreneur,"" David Morse\'s archbishop is imperious and difficult, matched growl for growl by John Lithgow\'s intractable mayor. Senior to them is the impressive Giancarlo Giannini as Pope Leo XIII, who assigns the NYC slums to Cabrini\'s future as the eventual patron saint of immigrants.\n\nMother Cabrini, despite her failing health and being a woman in a paternalistic society, is a superlative example of the feminist Gloria Steinem could imagine: kind and ambitious, tough and savvy, in love with children who need her love. It would be next to impossible not to shed a tear watching her build an orphanage and then hospitals in the spirit of her selfless mission to help the disadvantaged.\n\nBut then that is what this film does as it portrays the uncomfortable world of early 20th-century poverty while encouraging us to clap for the heroism of Cabrini and her soldiers, including a Mary-Magdalene-type prostitute, Vittoria ( Romana Maggiora Vergano). The comparison to Christ\'s journey is never emphasized, all the better to realize the everyday heroism of our fellow humans.\n\nI am impressed once again by the ability of director Monteverde and the Angel Studios to craft a biopic that reeks of reality while it spiritually transports to the worlds of authentic heroes. Cabrini is, like the current Oppenheimer, a true, albeit ""inspired by,"" biopic with heart and grit.', 'Angel Studios is doing something interesting here: they\'re making non-preachy value based films that are palatable by your average non-religious movie goer & yet they are using a ""pay it forward"" system of good doers to passionately promote it and literally pay for others to see it. What\'s more is this film, as well as Sound of Freedom, are extremely well made for the low budget independent movies they are. They\'re attracting top talent not because of religious guilt (like a Kirk Cameron Left Behind film might or religious dogma stuff God\'s Still Not Dead), no these actors are doing these roles because I think they see how strong of writing they have. David Morse, a vet actor, plays one of the best roles he\'s played in years & even a cameo style featured role of John Lithgow (the mayor) lets him seethe and breath slimy life into yet another wonderful villain role. Cristina Dell Anna in the title role is consistently strong & although it probably won\'t be treated with the same consideration for Oscar awards due to critics predisposition about the studio (supposedly run by Q\'anon supporters I think the stories have said), her role and many roles in the film are no worse than Oscar bait roles are in similar movies like Little Women. The filmmaking, the same as Sound of Freedom Director & also the Cinematographer, is once again very beautiful and visually stunning. Even if a few critics are (I think unfairly) rallying against it, like it or not, it\'s well made inexpensive and efficient cinema... the exact mid-budget made-for-adult serious cinema that used to be the bread & butter of Hollywood. If the studios are unwilling to make it, I\'m glad somebody is keeping up the tradition.\n\nThe film doesn\'t have a meta-self aware bone in its structure & that\'s refreshing. In creators race to reinvent the wheel of film theory, we forget these feel good tales until one comes along and reminds us how much we need a nice uplifting, not challenging society, story. The last film that had this kind of a feel, without religious guilt, was The Upside. I predict this might also do pretty well with the feel good crowd & their praise and money matters too!\n\nI read one critic call it bland, but I disagree. I think it\'s the kind of film that unabashedly appeals to your emotions over intellect, which some today call manipulative, but if done for a non-dogma cause is just called filmmaking. If religious people used films like this more, uplifting & non preachy, non-cliched and about more reality than biblical theory, I think more from outside the flock would see their perspective. It\'s only when you\'re sitting in a movie (like I\'ve seen a thousand times) where a cruel and uncaring god seems to be behind every misery in a very present way, when idiots like Kirk Cameron are acting ""holier than thou"" and spouting off hateful things supposedly in an effort to convert you that the average person rejects it. So often films have no pretense of entertainment and are really stupidly written only for those who are used to religious cliche & redundancy.\n\nHere, by contrast, we have some intelligent writing, a worthwhile true story about somebody extremely interesting and good who led an inspiring life... that\'s how to bring \'em in. Maybe some might be inspired to go to church more or like me, while I won\'t be becoming any more religious, still enjoyed seeing a woman who had faith fight for something good and decent... without strings... just like both Angel Studio movies I\'ve seen. Smart play. Well done. Like Sound if Freedom we have a movie about faithful people, but I would go so far as to say this isn\'t a ""faith movie"". Just like a movie may have a serial killer in it and not be a horror movie. I think they\'ve found a good middle ground & i\'d see a third movie.', ""An incredible and inspirational true story of a truly amazing woman! This movie will impact lives. If you're looking for some inspiration on how to make a positive difference in this world, go see this movie.\n\nCabrini is very well done with superb acting and every detail attended to to put you right there with Cabrini on her journey. You feel the struggle and you rejoice in her triumphs.\n\nI don't know how much the world knew about Cabrini before this movie, but I believe that the more that see it, the more will be inspired to do a little more and try a little harder to lift the burdens of our fellow men, women and children. She had a heart that was too great to be stopped!"", 'Unaware of the story of Mother Cabrini until watching in the theatre last night. Greatly enjoyed the story and production merits as well as solid acting from the cast. Angel Studios seem to thus far invest in worthwhile features that appeal to mass crowds, while avoiding being too preachy or overly sentimental regarding faith. The theatre was only a little full but the front section clapped at the end and folks stuck around to the end, including me, as I greatly enjoyed the end title song featured as well. I watched this as part of my AMC A-List membership but felt compelled to do at least one ticket on the pay it forward solicitation. Great film, well worth the 2.5 hours spent watching.', 'I love true stories of people accomplishing great things, especially when they must overcome the odds against them. This was the case in the movie ""Cabrini,"" an inspiring, motivating, suspenseful movie about a real woman and the good she accomplished through determination, persistence, and faith. It made me feel like I should be doing more with my life, but in a good way, not a way that made me feel small. We need to focus more on people who have overcome much in order to improve the lives of others and find happiness and satisfaction doing so. We need more movies like this, and fewer movies like the ones often produced.', 'This is a film about a astonishing, remarkable, marvelous woman - but poorly represented.\n\nEvery saint deals with needs other people, but not only that. The Saint is not a social worker, she/he is so much, much more than that, and none of that is represented in this unfortunate, failed portrayal of a great woman.\n\nShe is represented almost as a rebel (against the church), and she was not. She was represented as barely obedient to the church - also very untrue.\n\nShe never prayed once in the entire movie. You watch her and you don\'t feel her peace or God\'s love working through her, you just feel anger towards other people - which is imposible in Saints.\n\nThe story is not inspiring you to be a God\'s worker and God\'s peacemaker - but a revolutionary against other people.\n\nTotal, total miss. Unfortunately... This is not a Christian movie, it did us no favour. Someone else should\'ve filmed it. Look at ""A Man for all Season"", or ""Ghandi"", you would experience completely other feelings. They move you, and the inspire you to be peacefully and actively good (not rebeling).', 'My husband and I were able to see a sneak preview of this movie not knowing anything about it, not even the title. It is an old style epic you can watch with grandma and will have you whooping at the end (there is a conversation they show half of in the preview that a woman literally cheered at in the audience.) It is a piece of history that I knew very little about. The Italians are the newest immigrants in New York as the Irish immigrants are beginning to gain acceptance. There is modern feel in the way it reminds us that everyone has been the poor immigrant at some point and calls on us to remember that in the way we treat the newcomers or anyone else who is currently on the bottom of the pile. Yet rings modern. Unlike most modern epics today, there was no sense of preaching, just truth telling and a plain good movie. We plan on seeing it again soon with our family.', 'There is no doubt that the story of Mother Francis Xavier Cabrini is fascinating, and absolutely worthy of being remembered and told. I do wish it had been told more compellingly than in CABRINI, as by-the-book as a historical biography could be.\n\nCabrini was a nun, running an orphanage in Lombard, Italy near the end of the 19th century. But she aspired to lead a mission in China, with the goal of bringing hospitals, schools and (of course) Catholicism to those people, and then spreading her mission from there. Pope Leo XIII had different ideas and sent her to the US (NYC in particular) to help downtrodden Italian immigrants there. Cabrini and a handful of sisters travelled there, and managed to establish a truly impressive mission that eventually spread throughout the world. The movie primarily hones in on the time when Cabrini arrives in America and overcame the rather daunting obstacles that faced her in establishing a school/orphanage and then a hospital. The rest of her life is only summarized briefly in text before the closing credits. She faces predictable obstacles: no one wants to spend resources on those awful Italians. The mayor is utterly unsympathetic and the local archbishop, while clearly feeling the pull of the feelings that my first have drawn him to the priesthood, is still guided by his desire to keep his church prosperous by maintaining his relationships with local officials. But our title character uses determination, smarts and some well-placed deceptions to ""do what is right."" In particular, she gets the press on her side.\n\nIt\'s all interesting stuff, and certainly it\'s easy to feel outrage at the treatment of the immigrants living in squalor in Five Points. But the archbishop (David Morse) and mayor (John Lithgow), among others, are such cardboard villains, the movie just becomes less and less subtle. (And to a large degree, the good guys are pretty cardboard too...the prostitute with the heart of gold, the children who admire Mother Cabrini so much, the kindly doctor, etc. Etc.). Most nuance is missing here.\n\nThank goodness, though, for the subtle performance of Cristiana Dell\'Anna in the title role. I\'ve never heard of this Italian actress. She\'s a fairly mesmerizing presence. Cabrini dealt with serious health issues and thus was slight and a bit frail. Yet she had a will of steel, driven by her faith and her own ambition. Dell\'Anna conveys all of this with seemingly little effort; she really inhabits this role and her performance elevates this otherwise pedestrian film.\n\nAnd thank goodness she is so good. This IS a story worth telling (and one I didn\'t know at all); Dell\'Anna makes it worthwhile. So while I wish more elements were handled with more finesse (and I wish the CGI was not so bargain-basement), I can still comfortably recommend the film.', 'Wonderful, wonderful film! The writing, and acting was absolutely Outstanding!\n\nI\'m glad I went to see this movie. Thank GOD for this woman, her heart, drive, and courage! It is AMAZING and I am speechless at how far a reach Mother Cabrini has. She truly DID build an empire. I knew nothing about her before this film, although I heard her name years ago from the television show Good Times (Cabrini-Green). That name has stuck with me through the years, why?, I never knew. I know now. Cabrini sticks, she sticks with you. I feel honored to have ""met"" her.\n\nI applaud the writers and director for creating such a masterpiece! Thank you so, so much for this film! We need more films like this one, and people like you to make them happen.\n\nThanks for that beautiful ending. It brought on more tears at the theater, and it\'s bringing on tears now as I think about it.\n\nWELL DONE! To all involved.\n\nTHANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!', 'The cinematography of this film is executed so well. The angles, leading lines, contrasts, and grand vistas all come together and deliver an exceptional experience. A time period piece is always something that seems rather difficult to take on and it was done here flawlessly. I am a professional photographer and spend lots of time creating me scenes with toys and telling a story with characters and I loved the way this film delivered on all the check boxes. For me the marvel superhero movies are a dime a dozen with flashy speed death of the eye scenes so full of going-ons that no one really knows what is going on. Cabrini delivers on visuals while also telling a beautiful story pertinent to our times as much as historical significance. Cabrini is a movie worth seeing again and again on the big screen!', 'Cabrini is a movie that reminds us, as humans, that we need two things: Love and Tenacity. Without the first, we create gargantuan empires that destroy lives and sacrifice children at the alters of our selfishness. However, without the second, our words and actions are vapor that will do no one any good - no matter how sincere our intentions may be. If you wish to invigorate both of these qualities: Watch this movie.\n\nIn terms of the film and how it was made, it is another short of a master piece. The 4pmcinematography is gorgeous. The storyline is solid. The imagery is touching. The woman who plays Cabrini transmits the love and compassion and unbreakable will of a woman who literally changed the world.', ""As an extra in the Senate scene and after spending a day filming and learning what the scene was supposed to be, when it arrived on the big screen it was chopped up in the different direction than what they had originally chose, making it seem thrown together. Knowing that, and watching the entire movie I feel it should've been a three-part miniseries. It seemed that most of the scenes in the movie were chopped together and if there were more time, then more could be told about Mother Cabrini and how she got to where she was.\n\nAs an editor and producer for several podcasts I would break it down like this, the production and editing left a lot to be desired and the director could have done a better job."", 'Cabrini was a one-of-a-kind Movie experience. It renews your hope that one person can make a world of difference right here right now regardless of challenges by persevering in the good fight.\n\nThe movie was very well done. It showed the plight of the voiceless being tended to, rescued, and restored by those who know the truth that we are all made in the image of God and are worth fighting for.\n\nI sincerely hope that Angel brings out more films that amplify light by telling these true stories of heroes who have gone before us.\n\nSo glad to have had the chance to watch this film. Watch it, it may change your life.', ""Cabrini is fine in the sense that it tells a great story from the point of view of a social worker but disregards the catholic spirituality that made her a saint. Cabrini started her orphanages, schools, and hospitals becaise she had a profound love and relationship with God, who illuminated her to follow the gospel that is the life of Jesus Christ. Without her profound life of prayer which is comtemplation in the reason why we are born and why God created us Cabrini would of done nothing. The movie lacks telling the audience what motivated her actions, which were born from her love to God and that love which made her enter the religious life, moved her to love humanity. The movie ignores what made her a saint. Which is not her great works on earth, but her great love of the Holy Trinity: The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit. One God in three different persons. For anybody to become a saint one must have a mystjcal love with God and then the social works become the fruit of such love. This movie fails to inform the inception of why a saint becomes a saint, which is the love and unity with God that leads to a pure life of such a person. It was the grace which God bestowed upon Frances Xavier Cabrini which made her do everything great she did and the movie should of focused alot more on the catholic spirituality that was everything to Cabrini's essence."", 'Cabrini captures the old Catholic feel of dark cathedrals and solemn, monumental characters. However, it is also refreshing and heartwarming all at once. A movie that syncs your heart, and inspires the very best in all of us. The movie takes you through her desire to help others she hears are suffering, through her fight to raise awareness and support, to her stout heart and stubbernness to make it happen herself, to the incredible resistance and even persecution she endured, all to help the helpless and hopeless. The orphaned children, the poor, and the sick. And she did it, boldly and courageously. But most important, lovingly. I had no idea her story could be so impactful. We should all see this movie and see what strong women can truly do despite how low the world may sink, or corrupt its leadership may get!', 'Artfully filmed & beautifully acted but the screenplay is missing an essential element. It emphasizes that Cabrini succeeded mostly by her grit and self-determination. As Mother Cabrini herself taught her Sisters, ""We must pray without tiring, for the salvation of mankind does not depend on material success; ... but on Jesus alone."" Her faith was only vaguely hinted. I only recall 1 scene that showed even minimal prayer. What a shame that the writer & director could not have thrown in even occasional evidence that the source of her survival even as a young girl was her devotion and faith in God. Shame on Angel Studios.', 'Alejandro Monteverde has created a beautiful work of art that celebrates the life of Francesca Cabrini. Every frame of this film is a painting. I didn\'t know about her until I watched this film, but I left feeling inspired and motivated to persist and not give up.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the film is the sound design. You hear the drowning water sounds and the voices echoing in her mind to ""stay where you belong"" when she encounters opposition and challenge to her mission. Cabrini encountered obstacle after obstacle, and she did not ""stay where she belonged"".\n\nYes, this film is about a Catholic nun, but it really is a human story for everyone, whether you are a person of faith or not. Enjoy!', 'The newest biopic to hit theaters is probably the one I knew the least about. CABRINI is about an Italian Catholic missionary Francesca Cabrini (Cristiana Dell\'Anna), who had a debilitating lung disease. In the late 1800\'s, Italian immigrants were flocking to New York City, with the ""American dream"" in their hearts. They were welcomed with blatant racism and brutal conditions. They were treated worse than rats. Cabrini took it upon herself and her ""nun squad"" to build orphanages and hospitals for the immigrants, with New York only the first step of her plan. This movie had some good, powerful scenes in it. Despite that, it felt like it dragged, mostly in the middle. It\'s possibly meant to feel that way due to all the obstacles Cabrini faces along the way, but still. It could\'ve been tightened up, especially since it was a whopping 145 minutes long. Cristiana has a subtle but commanding performance, including David Morse and John Lithgow. The visuals and cinematography are very well done here, highlighting the dirty conditions and desperation of the times. CABRINI is fascinating to learn about, and I enjoyed seeing an unstoppable woman full of determination navigate an uphill battle to eventually become the first American saint, the patron saint of immigrants.', 'Mother Cabrini was a Catholic saint. Probably to ensure commercial success they had to leave out the very essence of her devotion and motivation -Our Lord and God. There was too much missing in this film..God for one, and the fact that she taught catechism. She likely baptized, she must have worked with priests who administered the Sacraments, but the priest was portrayed as a fool. And she prayed. I saw no representation of her prayers or her Catholic teaching or her devotion to Jesus Christ. Maybe we were supposed to figure she was praying during the shots of her stoically sitting in church. Odd. No kneeling, no hands pressed together in prayer. When I viewed the scene of her chugging a drink, I was done. This is a movie about ""Cabrini."" Not about Mother Cabrini, the saint. They forgot to mention the miracles that occurred in her name which brought her to sainthood. Such a shame to see this obvious anti Catholic bias. It could have been great.', 'A completely inspiring movie that leaves you asking ""What can I do to make my world a better place after I\'m gone?"" It causes one to see others as deserving of care and love, no matter who or what they\'ve done. Cabrini challenges the watcher to see life in the shoes of others, to lift up the fallen, the hurt and yes even the ""hurters"". Dramatic sweeping photography, understated heart wrenching Italian tenement squalor in a New York\'s ghetto. It will grab your heart and not let it go. A movie to go see and buy when it comes out on DVD/Blue-ray. Description of it in one simple word: Unforgettable.', ""True and amazing story that not many of us know. Powerful example of the impact that one woman can have against all odds by leading with passion, moral courage, perseverance, intelligence and heart. Mother Cabrini is my new favorite female leader.\n\nThe actors were well cast and the scenery in NY and Italy were real and beautiful and also very sad as they captured the life and times of the unhoused of that period. Sadly, the discrimination and greed at the turn of the century between the haves and the havenots resemble much of the challenges that exist in today's world just with different players.\n\nDon't miss this excellent and timely film."", ""Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.\n\nI am inspired to become a better person through this movie. It's an incredible story of how this one woman defied everything that told her to sit down and shut up, and instead selflessly extended her arms to everyone the world rejected. It inspires us to remove the blinders we have on ourselves and move in spite of our hurts and hangups and limitations, and instead reach out to the one who is need next to us. It's exactly what we need to be in this world, what we secretly hope to be, and what we can in fact achieve.\n\nAnd the only thing that matches it is the beauty of the movie itself. The colors. The sound. The composition. The music. The writing. The acting. Everything is beyond incredible and captivating. As a filmmaker, I understand the amazing things this director is doing with this film. Go and see it. You will not regret it."", 'Cabrini is a beautiful and inspiring biopic! It is exactly the kind of movie that we need more of in the cinema. It was not perfect by any means but is better than 90% of the movies that are made today. In terms of the story, I think it could have been better crafted and engaging since it dragged at times, but this is a common problem in biopics since there is usually a lot of ground to cover. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone interested in viewing an inspiring story of this less-than-familiar saint whose selfless determination helped thousands of people and who made the world a better and more beautiful place.', 'Cabrini is an inspiring beautifully filmed and acted movie, based on the real life accomplishments of Mother Cabrini. I am not a Catholic, so I was not familiar with this story. It was emotional and thought provoking and hits the very essence of service and love for all humanity. It promotes the powerful love and compassion that a a true feminist would find inspiring, while simultaneously teaching what all man and woman of every race and background are capable of. It describes what a loving world we could have if we just thought more about serving others and instead of worrying about, ""what\'s in it for us"". An absolute gem that needed to be made. It\'s what a film should be.', ""This is a fantastic true story that I was excited to see another film from Sound of Freedom director Alejandro Monteverde. The cinematography is truly epic almost looking like a Rembrandt painting with so many fantastic shots it was breathtaking and the acting superb with incredible set designs and costumes.\n\nThe story of Cabrini is unfortunately built up too slowly in the 1st act with pointless scenes that drag the pacing of the story almost completely focused on her business/ politics that it feels almost one dimensional -focused on New York only versus the impressive Cabrini Empire of Hope and Church, Hospitals and Universities across the entire world and her Miracles and famous catechism are barely covered in this miopic film.\n\nIt's still an impressive feat that most will enjoy yet it could have been a masterpiece considering what Saint Cabrini accomplished in her lifetime instead of reading highlights in the footnotes at the end of the film.\n\nMake sure to stay for the Biocelli sing at the end\n\nA solid 7 stars but could have been a 10 Looking forward to this directors next film."", ""Cabrini is the finest movie ever made about a 19th Century stunning, stoic, strong Italian immigrant woman who wasn't afraid to stand up to a male-dominated world, both within the Catholic church and within the powerful government of New York City. She fought for the orphaned children who were living in squalor in the sewers & slums of NYC. The rats were even living better than the children. Disease was rampant & no one was listening to her pleas for assistance. She was tenacious, determined, and refused to give up, even while living with a lung condition that often weakened her. She also wanted to open hospitals because the local ones refused to take immigrants who were too poor to pay their medical bills. I had never heard about her until this movie. Now, after seeing it, she has become one of my all time heroes!"", ""Mother Cabrini changed the world top to bottom. She successfully built hospitals, housed thousands of orphans, and changed immigrants across the world. The movies cinematography was a masterpiece! The actors drew you in.

The movie flowed like a smooth river putting the Producers at the top of their field. The strength Cabrini through faith and perseverance was a force to reckon with. I will never forget Cabrini's strength. Angel Studios is on a role with high quality films that take your breath away and keep you coming back for the next film!"", ""Giving this an 6/10 rating\n\nThe film is a look at another true tale of someone I never heard of , Francesca Cabrini, a nun on a mission to save as many as possible and the real pitfalls she faced getting stuff done.

She was a very great woman of faith.

If you are not sure about Cabrini, I recommend trying to get a free ticket.\n\nI won\'t tell people to see Cabrini but I also won\'t tell them not to. It was an enjoyable film to a point but could of been released at a later date.', 'I attended the movie with my wife expecting it to be about a group of nums who came to America to establish a school for Orphans. I left the theatre astounded on how this little fraile nun with a life threatening disease was desitned to make her impact on the world through perseverance and fortitude greater than most men. She let nothing stop her from accomplishing her missions in life. This includes the Pope, the Major of NYC and others in high society. Her can do attitude and the idea nothing is impossible with God drove her to live far beyond what the doctors had predicted. A must see movie.', 'I did not have any high expectations before watching this but the movie was a pleasant surprise.\n\nI am not a religious person but the power of selfless service, love touched me and made me think about the real-life Cabrini.\n\nLead actor and the supporting actors have really acted well. Loved the portrayal of feministic determination and fight in a male-dominated system/society without any melodrama. Lead actor really played the role with lot of restraint which I really liked. Also the movie dialogues/screenplay were very realistic and powerful without resorting to any cheesiness.\n\nI was a bit surprised that there was not a single scene(AFAIK, in one scene she sits in a church but never seen praying) where the character Mother Cabrini prays to God in despair. IMO it would have added to emotional depth and would have shown her source of strength. But it seems like a conscious decision to underplay the religious side and emphasise the female determination, grit, persistence and motherly side. But was it really the case with Cabrini?(I don\'t know, I have not done my research apart from a quick wiki check).\n\nCinematography is really superb. Several of the frames in the movie where fit to be superb paintings. The play of light and darkness is also amazing(maybe an indication of struggle between good vs bad).\n\nMusic was also really good.\n\nAnd recreation of 19th century NewYork also seemed authentic.\n\nI was a bit surprised by the very high quality of movie production by a relatively small productions like Angel Studios(maybe its a big studio but I had only heard of it from ""The chosen"" series).\n\nEven though I am not religious, I really like these kind of movies with religious realism instead of cliched mindless religious garbage. Hope in future more such thoughtful, spiritual movies are made.', ""One of the best, most emotional, heartfelt movies I've seen in a long time. I empathized and connected.\n\nIn these end of days, it was beautiful to have been inspired with Cabrini's faith and courage. Faith CAN move mountains and I'm delighted her story was told. I hope it did her honor. My heart melted. This is inspiring for women or men. We are all human.\n\nWhoever paid it forward, I would like to thank, as it was my daughter's birthday, and it has been a difficult time for us. Thank you!!!\n\nThe music was shockingly perfect and the actors and actresses did not a miss a beat. The visual quality was amazing. Arriba Italia!\n\nI absolutely loved all of it ! Everyone should definitely see this."", ""Film illuminated Mother Frances Cabrini's savvy Entrepreneurial sense and how she had 3 strikes already against her - she was Italian in a place Italians were not wanted, she was a woman and she was Catholic. Never thought I would like a Chick Flick so much ! Believe it or not, a miracle was not portrayed but many were to come with the seeds being planted. Giancarlo Giannini as Pope Leo the thirteenth played the Super-Pope to a Tee ! David Morse as Archbishop Corrigan Guarded Mother like a rigid Girls High School basketball coach, while Wicked warlock of the Westside, Mayor Gould (John Lithgow) was eager to entice Mother's ( Cristiana Dell'Anna) demise. An excellent periodic piece by Angel Studios !! A must see for the Faithful and Faithless !"", '""A single act of humility is worth more than the proud exhibition of any virtue."" Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini.\n\nAngel Studios compelling storyline in the brilliant feature film \'Cabrini\' with its casting offered tremendous performances that truly embodied the weight of, ""We can serve our weakness, or we can serve our purpose."" The same goes for how Angel Studios has chosen to execute its filmmaking strategies, which are heartwarming, inspiring and brave storylines they select to offer global audiences. The messages of hope prevail over despair of the modern times that offer us challenges to evil that are as old as time itself.- George Zouvelos.', ""Beautiful movie artistically. Beautifully filmed. Didn't realize Angel studio was Church of LDS backed movie.\n\n(Not a Roman Catholic Depiction ) A feminist story not A SAINT story devoted to GOD and her strength coming from fasting and devotion to prayer for guidance of GOD.\n\nStill a very important story to tell even with the omission of God But an amazing production with heartfelt emotion. Especially me being Italian American seeing this movie in the shoes of my grandparents one set from Naples to NY the other from Sicily to NY then all settled in Chicago west side. I know they experienced hateful remarks, racism and intolerable conditions but they survived and made a life for themselves and their families. I wouldn't be here if not for their courage and devotion."", ""The life of Sister Cabrini was told with such passion and love. The direction and cinematography was excellent. The actors were just superb. Well done Alejandro Gmez Monteverde and all of your associates. Incredibly well done movie that opens your eyes to the struggles of immigrants in the late 19th century. All of the performers did excellent jobs. Mother Cabrini 's kindness and perseverance were inspirational. I knew nothing about the subject of this movie, but someone I know really wanted to see it and asked me if I'd join him and I'm glad I did! The story was fascinating, the acting was superb, and the cinematography was excellent. The movie and everyone involved in it definitely deserve to win Oscars for this amazing film. The acting, cinematography, music, all lend a feeling of authenticity to the film. The story moves along, despite the almost 139 minute film. The depiction of the Italian immigrant experience has many parallels in our current times. Mother Cabrini was a beacon of light in those dark times. We desperately need someone like her now. The premise of the film-- what will you do when faced with suffering of your neighbors, will stick with you long after the final credits play. There are quite a bit of English subtitles during some Italian language scenes, but the font size and print is easy to see. Cristiana Dell'Anna was compelling - did an outstanding job! Very powerful and believable performance. That said, this was worth my time, attention and too much popcorn. The story is told in a way that keeps our humanity and our inhumanity ever present. And reminds us of the power of ONE and especially one who will go to great lengths to make sure we understand and that we don't forget.\n\nIn conclusion: Cabrini told a beautiful story and every character was a part of that story. The absence of prayer or rosary never struck me, nor if the pope was a smoker - though I imagine one or two might have. Her story - the story being told was that of unrelenting focus; commitment and refusal to submit to powerful forces in her quest to serve others.\n\nMy predictions is that this is by far better than IMAGINARY all because Imaginary came out the same weekend as Kung Fu Panda 4 which kids love pandas fighting in action, horror fans would probably not going to see this because dialogue, script, writing and story was very bad. This film is the best one of this year and we're in early March already so which means we're still on the way to December of this year only several more months away from now, time flies man, time flies. I'd rated 9/10 because there is some nit picky scenes I didn't quite get but overall it's still an excellent film than IMAGINARY."", ""What a beautiful well done movie. I am from New York , am Catholic, and grew up learning about Mother Cabrini.\n\nI was inspired by Mother Cabrini and chose nursing to assist with the healing process in the hospital setting. I went to a Catholic hospital school of nursing.\n\nThe movie was amazingly true to the time period and Mother Cabrini was a strong influence and her belief in God's grace, love, mercy, and loving spirit was expressed extremely well. Her love of caring for the children is what God led her to do. Mother Cabrini never lost her vision to care for the children of poverty of all nations around the globe. Thank you for a wonderful life story of Mother Cabrini."", 'My Review of Cabrini:\n\nThe Scene: Pulling Water from the Well reminds me of the Lenten Gospel when Christ met the woman at the well and told her everything she ever did in her life. For when we can hear His cry of , ""I Thirst"" we know who to go to find mercy and forgiveness.\n\nSurviving means trusting in God, having resilience, (or gogorrah) and seeing the events of your life through Christ\'s view: in light of eternity.\n\nSome of the thematic elements do not quote scripture precisely, but it is in the power of silence, when we give Him room, that He speaks. (Please read Cardinal Sarah\'s book:) on how every human being can ""survive"" this world which is a field hospital according to Pope Francis: in prayer, silence and reception of the sacraments. ""The Power of Silence"" is a delightful read for me this lent.\n\nI find it remarkable that this story uses The NY Times to tell the same story that was told about the slum children of 5pts: living and dying in the gutter likes rats, just like our children of the Kizito Family Haiti-USA. The violence, filth, disease and loss of innocence is being ignored today because it is not ""profitable"" for the west to intervene.\n\n#kizitofamily\n\nI find it sad that the producers of the film used condemning and dark music when depicting the hierarchy of the Church, using subconscious undertones to paint priests, bishops and the pope in a bad light and also the use of images of hell to end this story of one of the greatest American saints. I loved the pauses of silence and how she was continually blessed with real estate to provide for those desperately in need! It kinda gave me a little inspiration of my own life and calling to be a saint up on the big screen.\n\nBut I guess the fire of the Holy Spirit sets the world ablaze with the fire of his love and purifies/cleanses us from sin.', ""This movie is a breath of fresh air in a stale world full of vapid conversations, closed hearts, and no values to speak of. Angel Studios artfully captured Cabrini's struggles in this biopic.\n\nI know of no other movie that has opened my heart to charity like this one has. Saint Cabrini of blessed memory moved mountains to help the poor, the sick, and the downtrodden. Her portrayal in this film was superb. I implore you to go watch this movie as soon as you can because it very well may change your life.\n\nI simply can't imagine a better film to spend 2 hours to watch than this one. You won't regret it.\n\nGod bless 🙏"", 'Greetings again from the darkness. \'Where there\'s a will, there\'s a way.\' That famous saying should be known as a ""Cabrini"". For anyone whose impression of nuns is that of irascible old women swatting misbehaving students with rulers during school hours, filmmaker Alejandro Monteverde (SOUND OF FREEDOM, 2023) and co-writer Rod Barr have just the biopic for you.\n\nCristiana Dell\'Anna stars as Mother Francesca Cabrini, the most stubborn and persistent nun you\'ll ever see, and one\'s whose accomplishments deserve to be known by all. The film opens by informing us that between 1889 and 1910 more than two million Italian immigrants came to the United States. Lest you believe the image of immigrants has never been worse than it is today, the film portrays the extreme racism and bigotry of the times. On top of that, Cabrini faced vile misogyny and the hatred that accompanied it. So what was her sin? Well, her vision was to create orphanages and hospitals so that immigrants, especially kids, would have a decent place to live and a community that could care for them. Imagine the nerve.\n\nNot just nerve, but backbone, guile, and the strength to not accept ""no"" for an answer from the men in power. This is the true story of the early days of Cabrini\'s mission. After being told in Italy to ""stay where you belong"", Pope Leo XIII (Giancarlo Giannini) refuses to allow her to go to China; however, she accepts his compromise of New York City. Arriving in the Five Points area, she witnesses poverty and squalor for Italians, yet is initially rebuked by Archbishop Corrigan (David Morse), a man who doesn\'t want to ruffle the feathers of Mayor Gould (John Lithgow).\n\nThe story is remarkable and the acting solid. Also deserving of mention is the look of the film. Production Design is superb and the cinematography of Gorka Gomez Andreu gives the film the beautiful throwback look of yesterday\'s masterworks. If there\'s a flaw here, it\'s that we are never really certain how much time has passed as Cabrini goes toe-to-toe with various power brokers and moves from one project to the next. Still, we understand that the film covers just the early stages of her work, not the complete story. More than two dozen books have been written on Cabrini\'s achievements before her death at age 67. She was remarkable and accomplished so much for one who was told to remain bedridden as a youngster. All of this was on borrowed time.\n\nHer story is inspirational, as she built a charitable empire worldwide run by women. The film features a song by Virginia Bocelli and her father Andrea Bocelli over the end credits. It should also be noted that the religion aspect here is not overplayed. Instead, it\'s the story of a woman (later canonized as a Saint) who believed, ""Begin the mission and the means will come."" Available on streaming services.', 'The story as told is quite direct but could have had more of true story feelings in regards to the faith a more in depth display of the life of this Saint as she interacts with dialogue of prayer to God an immersion of emotions of her actual feelings..it was slightly there but should of been enhanced more so despite her struggles of peril it was over come with faith and not just self. It was missing that effect and emphasizing of her overcoming her struggles of dryness and depth of her emotions. The initial impression was favorable but seemed to get lost towards the middle of movie. The character parts were adequate to set the tone and storyline but the actual plot could of been more faith driven.', ""Sometimes when you see a movie, you are entertained or amused for a little while. Sometimes we come away inspired, moved and forever changed, that's what Cabrini does for anyone who experiences this film.\n\nThis isn't a make believe story but a real life reveal of an important person who has relevance in today's world. Truly an amazing story of perseverance in the face of overwhelming obstacles by someone who wasn't willing to accept no as an answer when it came to serving those who were vulnerable and hopeless. A story of faith and strength despite perceived weakness. Truly God can still use people to accomplish his mission if they are willing to be used by Him."", 'Watched it last night with my sister and husband. This was a great movie I never knew about her and the wonderful things she did. It is definitely a must see!! I have even read up on her and found she had a place in Colorado which we are going to go and check out. She was a wonderful person who did amazing things she had opened 67 orphanages and hospitals. She did so much for children and people who were hurt or sick. She also did alot for the immigrants to. The movie is very good I hope and pray that lots of people go and watch it we need more good in this world now days this movie teaches love and kindness no matter who you are!', 'Providing care, comfort and compassion to the world\'s downtrodden is undoubtedly a noble, if exhausting and often-frustrating, cause, especially when pleas for help go ignored or fall on deaf ears. Yet, every so often, someone comes along who tirelessly keeps on fighting for those less fortunate, as was the case with Italian immigrant Mother Francesca Cabrini (Cristiana Dell\'Anna). Upon her arrival in New York in 1889, the diminutive but zealous nun from Lombardy set about her work to care for her fellow countrymen and women (especially orphaned and abandoned children) in desperate need of food, housing and medical care, the first charitable undertaking of what she envisioned becoming a worldwide network of such ventures. She successfully raised awareness of the plight of these emigrees by getting the attention of a New York Times reporter (Jeremy Bobb), an endeavor that garnered support for her efforts and challenged the prejudicial attitudes of the public and New York\'s municipal government, including its bigoted, intolerant mayor (John Lithgow). And, through it all, she wrestled with personal health issues that hung over her for many years. Writer-director Alejandro Monteverde\'s latest presents a detailed, well-told biography of a woman who wouldn\'t give up at a time when the deck was stacked against her, both on the bases of her gender and nationality, as well as (in some cases) as a representative of the Church. The picture\'s superb production design, fine period piece production values and gorgeous cinematography lend much to this release, as do the performances of Dell\'Anna and Lithgow, along with a host of supporting characters. Despite these strengths, though, this slightly overlong offering has occasional problems with pacing, monodimensional character development, overdramatic elements (particularly in the soundtrack) and an underdeveloped back story. At the same time, however, ""Cabrini"" tells an inspiring and uplifting tale of someone who accomplished a lot but hasn\'t really received the attention she\'s due. This film helps to make up for that oversight while reminding us all that we can play a part in fulfilling her dream of genuinely creating an empire of hope for the world.', ""Refreshing to my independent, entrepreneurial and mystic soul. Highly recommend to those seeking direction. Given current worldwide migrations, being reminded of what right action looks and feels like in response is poignant and promising. For women seeking to balance feminine and masculine energies, Mother Cabrini is a role model. A treat to see John Lithgow as the simmering antagonist. David Morse's performance exposes the contradictions and complexities of a functionary of the Catholic Church near the end of the Victorian Age. Cristiana Dell'Anna sparkles and snaps as only a Sister on a mission from God can."", ""The impact this 5 foot woman had was incredible. Her drive to do what's right despite near impossible obstacles was inspiring. The movie told the story without lecturing the audience. The acting and cinematography were so well done, and the script kept the story moving. It didn't seem like a 2 1/2 hour film.the attention to detail made the period come to life. It also accurately depicted the attitude toward women that prevented them from obtaining positions of authority. Mother Cabrini just ignored the difficulty with faith and zeal to do the right thing. It also shows the attitude immigrants face when they arrive and how it takes generations to overcome this."", ""Cabrini is an amazing movie that all should see. For technical movie lovers, the production and editing are outstanding and the actors and actresses portray their roles fabulously! For story lovers, this is an incredibly inspiring story of a woman that wouldn't take no for an answer. She had a vision and she intended to make that vision come true. In the process, she helped thousands and thousands of human beings. I'm not sure there was a dry eye in the house at the end. As soon as the movie was over, I remembered the name Cabrini as it related to the name of a Chicago Housing Authority project and wondered if had to do with Mother Cabrini. Sure enough, it did. Go see this movie and take your family members that are teens and up and all your friends too."", ""CABRINI is masterfully crafted from beginning to end. I felt as though I stepped into the screen to experience this true story about sacrifice and love for humanity. All the performances, especially Cristiana Dell'Anna as Mother Cabrini, David Morse as Archbishop Corrigan, have captured the true essences of their characters. Director, Alejandro Monteverde has painted a powerful epic of Italian immigrant life in NYC. The cinematography becomes another character. Cabrini is a film for all ages. As an Italian American, I'm humbled to finally see a film that honors the Italian contribution to America."", ""If you have ever had a dream of doing something big, or making a difference in this world and you lacked the ambition, discipline or the sheer willpower to make it happen, this movie will you strip you of every excuse.\n\nThis amazing woman, who we remember during Women's month, conquered New York with tremendous courage and grace while modeling the compassion and love of God to those who needed to experience it most. In addition, she did this during a time when it was absolutely a man's world. She broke down each mans barrier using respect and determination to make a way when it seemed impossible.\n\nNothing but love and admiration for Mother Cabrini and the movement she created along with her numerous accomplishments.\n\nThank you Angel studios for another amazing experience."", 'One of the best ""based on true events"" movies I have seen in quite some time...fabulous acting and directing...I learned so much from this movie-not really a subject I had any visibility on prior...Angel Studios has a way of selecting subject matter that is not normally talked about or viewed- but should be!...although it\'s a fairly long movie, more than 2 hours- I never had the desire to look at my watch to see what time it was...in fact I wanted to see more...no one in the theater got up from their seats before the entire credits rolled...the movie triggered me to look into the subject matter to learn more once I got home...highly recommend.', ""This movie was so well done. I did not know of Mother Cabrini, but if you are looking for a true story about a life that made such a difference; a strong woman who wouldn't take no for an answer and who eventually reached around the world, this is the movie for you. Thank you Angel Studios for quality entertainment. I may start going to the movies again with films like this. Every aspect of the movie was strong: the way they told the story, the acting, and the cinematography. I highly recommend seeing this film. It had moments of sadness with an overall story of strength, determination, courage and inspiration."", ""My wife and I loved this movie.\n\nIt was heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. We also learned get historical information. It is one of the best shows I've seen.\n\nThe New York back drops depicting NY in the late 1890's was amazing. There is nothing high tech or fake looking. You actually feel you are there and can feel the pain brought on my poverty and the hardships a new immigrant faced in a very unfriendly country and city.\n\nIf you like real history, this is a must see.\n\nI highly recommend Cabrini to everyone.\n\nWhat she accomplished in New York and around the world is beyond my imagination."", ""I wasn't aware that I would need to read subscripts throughout the movie. The movie is in Italian so you will need to focus in on the subtitles. I find this very annoying.\n\nI know this story is a good one and has been told many times. I do think Angel Studios did an excellent job with this move, direction, production, etc. But, still I don't want to read my movies, I would rather watch them.\n\nIt is a good story and faith based. It is a real and true story, sad, depressing, encouraging, inspirational, enlightening, etc. I only give my rating as I hate foreign movies and hate to read subtitles. Like on NetFlix where you can't filter to U. S. movies only."", ""Cabrini is an outstanding film with great cinematography and a much needed message for our times. It is an esthetically pleasing film to watch, but most of all it gives us hope. Mother Cabrini is motivated by her faith in God and her love of the poor to overcome seemingly countless obstacles encountered by Italian immigrants in 19th Century America. She faces man's inhumanity to man with love, faith, and determination. By not giving up in adversity, her resolve exposes the weakness of men. She not only confronts the frailty of those who are willing to settle for less as they make concessions to get what they believe is possible, but she reveals the true weakness of men corrupted by power, wealth, and influence. Cabrini is unstoppable because she relies on strength in God to overcome the seemingly impossible. Rather than a philanthropist or a feminist ahead of her time, Cabrini is an Italian woman who selflessly uses her feminine genius, often at personal risk, for the dignity of others."", ""Truly a movie of substance which can have a powerful impact on many cultural areas around the world, if one believes that love is the driving force. Without love for your fellow man/ woman, evil is present and couldn't be shown more clearly than in Cabrini. This masterpiece can make us look in the proper direction, if we really want to.\n\nThe cinematography, acting, directing and script were spot on. A beautiful movie from an aesthetic point of view. So many directorial shots that were reminiscent of scenes that could have been depicted by Velasquez, Vermeer or Rembrandt.\n\nThe use of Italian actors rather than British or American actors created a depth to reality rather than watching a movie and pretending."", 'What a beautiful story of this nun. She truly loved and served the downtrodden and forsakes! Just so happened to be the Italian immigrants in NYC around 1900. Same politics, prejudice and crime then as is now. She was brave and heroic. The movie was made well enough, some lovely ,but repetitive, shots of silhouettes in doorways. This movie is wonderful in that it gives attention she deserves after doing so much for so many. But I am still scratching my head over how a Christian production company can make a film about a devout nun and never show her praying or giving God any glory. I think she mentioned Him once at the beginning of the film to the Pope.', ""This movie was fantastic. This movie will wake you up! It was awesome! Several well known actors and the cast knew what they were doing. No amatures here. Go see it for yourself. Awesome movie. This movie will make you think about your life and ask if you are living it to the fullest. Angel Studios has released another Home Run. If you didn't see Sound of Freedom, you should. I would never have thought I would like Cabrini as much as I did. Cabrini's tenacity may surprise you.

It should be commended for that alone. Not quite the well executed violence of Violent Night, Red One takes a more light hearted approach with its dark action fantasy that can cater to a broader audience. It did this by attempting to combine action, with a heartfelt message and Christmas lore. Although it faltered in its execution mainly due to plot points, CGI and not fully capturing the Christmas spirit, the ambition of the film should be commended and it was boosted by performances from its lead cast. Whilst it won't any prestigious Xmas shortlists, it's a stocking filler that can be enjoyed at family gatherings."", ""I watched Red One yesterday, and I really enjoyed it. I thought it would be kind of trashy , but it was well made. It felt like what you'd get if Marvel made a Christmas movie-full of action, humor, and holiday spirit.

Dwayne Johnson's character as E. L. F was a quite fun fit. This movie was giving my boyfriend and me plenty of laughs throughout. Overall, it was wholesome, light, and fun.\n\nI wouldn't rush to see it in theaters, but it's perfect for a cozy night on the couch.

He had ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST in that child at all but suddenly we were ambushed with him desperate to rescue him when he didn\'t even want to pick him up from school an hour earlier.\n\nJK Simmons and particularly Lucy Lui were wasted on this really with their bit parts and their salary should have been invested into a more credible actor for the villain to give it some gravitas.\n\nI wasn\'t heart warmed by this movie or even remotely excited at the prospect of Christmas, it may as well have been released in July for the buzz it created.\n\nPeople fell asleep put it that way.', 'Red One! Today I got to watch Red One in theatres! I must say it was a lot of fun! Dwayne The Rock Johnson is one of my favorite actors. I must say he does a great job at playing roles in family friendly movies. Red One is great for the big screen due to the cinematography and the special effects. Even the sound effects are great for the big screen. The movie is very family friendly as it follows a kind of novel. The storyline itself is somewhat mysterious and has a sense of redemption undertone to it, as most Christmas movies do. I also enjoy the humor and the action in it. Plus it includes some classic Christmas characters in it. A definite must watch on the big screen for any Christmas movie fanatics. The only thing I think could have been better is maybe a bit more drama or emotion. Other than that a great film.', ""6.5/10 Evans and Johnson's chemistry as a duo shines in this action-comedy fantasy film, they do make a fun pair, especially with Evans, who always does well in this type of comedic role, while Red One wasn't a particularly great movie for me overall, it still had its entertaining moments, mostly thanks to Evans and Johnson, my biggest disappointment with Red One was some of the action scenes especially when you have Dwayne Johnson in it, and with his physique, it feels unnecessary to give him powers that make him shrink while fighting five men, it's easy to believe he could handle them on his own and it could give us a better and more exciting action with it, the movie had quite a bit of cheesy material, and story-wise, it became overly silly at times, especially in the fantasy elements, that said, some fantasy elements did work, for example, Kristofer Hivju as Krampus was excellent, the movie also made me chuckle a few times, and overall without Evans entertaining performance and Johnson's strong presence, Red One would have fallen flat, it's really their chemistry that elevates the film, the rest, from the action to the storyline, is decent but has its share of flaws."", ""The one word I can use to describe this film, is polarizing. The movie had a somewhat interesting plot that was executed in such a lackluster and cliche way. The cinematography and editing was also boring and at times so bad that it was hard to watch. Particularly in the first fight scene of the movie the editing had so many jump cuts that I had to close my eyes cause it was causing me a headache. Visually the movie was very dark and bland, the designs of the mythic creatures in the movie were very bad and it was clear this movie did not have the budget it needed to make the affects and designs work well. One other big issue I had with this movie is its tone, I genuinely can't tell who it was made for. The swearing and dark themes make it hard for kids to get into and enjoy while the movie also being too childish and boring for teens and adults to enjoy it. Overall, it was a bland corporate mess that I highly suggest you avoid."", 'I can guarantee to you the second you hear both ""Dwayne Johnson"" and ""Christmas"" you know the whole plot. I wasn\'t expecting anything different to what we got. Heading to the theatre very sceptical over what I would be coming to see but I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. I thought Chris Evans was amazing however, he seemed like one of the only parts of the film who genuinely enjoyed himself throughout the shooting. He played how I knew and thought he would be dumb fun stupidity\n\nThe film is hilarious in my opinion I mentioned Chris Evans but Dwayne was decent and he two of them balance their specialties and traits perfectly that of course being action-comedy. I honestly couldn\'t see a genre come off working with these two besides that. Action is strong with decently co-hersed fight scenes, of course nothing new for the pair. J. K. Simmons for me is one of the weaker depictions of santa clause we have gotten in cinema, just doesn\'t feel like he fits into the film well especially for a PG-13 setting. The gold medal for my far and away favorite sequences in the film has to go to the Germany Krampus scenes Kristofer Hivju plays the Anti-Hero in stunning light and is a breath of fresh air for this film and offered a fairly good heap of comedy in the film.\n\nBut on the opposite end of the spectrum Gryla is so ugh. Dull, boring and nothing new. She\'s literally just a microcosm for the entire film something we\'ve seen before muffled over with a Christmas blanket. I do wish we get something more for Dwayne Johnson across his film career instead of just fight, action, fight.', 'A playful adventure about rescuing Santas that has enough energy to entertain us. After Santa Claus is kidnapped, the film introduces us to a layered and continuous world building, they took great pains to show us all the luxury and grandeur of that universe, where the locations look quite colorful. The North Pole is to be given a futuristic glow, where the snow never stops, and the joy and happiness never stops with stylish architecture, while the Krampus abode exudes dark buildings from the distant past that are surrounded by statues as if they fell out of a nightmare. Dwayne Johnson as Callum was quite, his character began to doubt that people can improve or be better, and he struggles with this throughout the film. While Evans left a fair impression in the role of Jack, who is a master of finding people or any things, but his private life is in shambles, the dynamic between the two is filled with good moments, especially when they try to connect more deeply, but occasionally the whole impression is very superficially generic. Dialogues. Lucy Liu is good to see and she gave us some bad ass moments. The mythology is in full imaginative swing, with unexpected appearances of some famous creatures, to the way some of them have an intriguing history together, it brings intrigue. Action scenes can be excellent, but they can also lack a little convincingness, because cgi can gain in some areas, but the final conflict was quite well thought out and wrapped in excitement.', ""I just watched the movie with my kids, and it was fantastic!\n\nIt combines action and humor with heartwarming moments that prompted some introspection as a dad.\n\nAlthough the plot is straightforward, it presents a fresh perspective that resonated with me.\n\nDwayne Johnson and Chris Evans have great chemistry, showcasing Evans' versatility beyond his Captain America role.\n\nJ. K. Simmons delivers an outstanding performance as Santa, addressing the classic question of how he delivers presents in one night. Overall, I loved it and highly recommend it.\n\nP. S. Don't judge a movie without watching it first."", ""I was looking forward to this fun action comedy as I usually love movies of this genre, but was disappointed. I always go into films with a positive outlook but sadly I found myself zoning out at different points. The story just didn't grab me and I felt like I wasted my time :(\n\nI still hope others enjoy the movie more than I did and at least give it a chance rather than listening to the early critic reviews.\n\nChris Evans was the main draw for me to watch this movie and although the acting from this cast is not bad, the story just didn't hit in the way I wanted it to. Also, don't wait for a post-credits scene like everyone in my cinema."", ""Red One is a pretty bad movie with an okay story, terrible dialogues and mediocre technical achievements.\n\nThe story is very predictable with one twist that got me. The movie wouldn't be that boring with a fairly well-written script, but the dialogues were absolutely terrible. The characters did have arcs, and that's the best part about it, because they were very clichéd and predictable.\n\nThe camera work was pretty okay in the beginning, but by the end I couldn't see any of the action, there was nothing special about the cinematography. The pacing could've been a lot better. The most insane thing about this movie is the fact that they spent 250 million dollars and the CGI was below average in a couple of scenes. The acting performances were also terrible or mediocre except for one scene between Jack and his son.\n\nRed One could be a fun watch, but it's too long, there's too much bad CGI and some of the actors didn't give a damn."", ""Dwayne Johnson is the E. L. F. - Santa's bodyguard, Lucy Liu is head of Santa's covert operations, a beefcake Santa is surprisingly muscly JK Simmons, who with Bonnie Hunt as Mrs. Santa, Kristopher Hidju as Krampus, & as shape-shifting witch Grylla, Kiernan Shipka head the cast in this fast and furious thriller meets Jumanji at Christmas movie which happens to be by Fast & Furious/Jumanji writers. How is it there's never been a film like this before? Inventive & fun, it's likely to reside in the annual Christmas film watchfest lineup. The satisfying story is full of twists and convoluted turns. A holiday winner."", 'I thought this came to the cinemas about a month early, but it\'s still an amiable adventure showcase for Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans. It all starts on Christmas Eve when Santa Clause (J. K. Simmons) is kidnapped from his North Pole home. It\'s retirement time for his head of security ""Cal"" (Johnson) so he\'s not best pleased after hundreds of years - and working with ""Zoe"" (Lucy Lui) he has to find out just how his boss\'s security was compromised in the first place - and then get to the rescuing bit. That search leads them to tech whizz ""Jack"" (Chris Evans) but he hadn\'t any idea whom his client actually was. After a rocky start, the two men must pull their resources and save Santa before Christmas really does start to deal with all of us on the naughty list. It\'s got bits of ""Elf"" in it, mingled with some ""Harry Potter"" elements and to be fair to all concerned, they all look like they are having some fun amidst a surfeit of CGI and very tightly choreographed action scenes that mix the modern and the mythological entertainingly enough. Simmons and Liu don\'t really feature so much and the moral of good vs evil isn\'t lost in the delivery but it isn\'t laboured either. Perhaps it\'s not a movie you will ever remember seeing, but as far as it goes it\'s a fun vehicle for it\'s stars to cheer us up as the festivities approach without too much sentiment or cheese.', 'Just wanted to stop by and say that neither I nor my date enjoyed this movie. Once we realized it wasn\'t for us, we left the theater and ended up having an amazing night. It might even qualify as a canon moment in what I call ""The Project"" (don\'t worry-it\'s an inside joke). Hopefully, she\'ll become my girl, and tonight\'s experience with your movie helped us take another step forward. While the film wasn\'t to our taste, it served as the perfect catalyst for an unforgettable evening.\n\nSince I\'m so grateful, I\'m taking my sister and niece to watch it. Maybe they\'ll enjoy it. Who knows?\n\nThank you.', ""When I first heard about this movie, I got excited and I thought this would be a fun action holiday movie that I can put on during the Christmas season. However, that initial excitement started to faded when I found out what the movie's budget was going to be and that this is one of the movies where The Rock was constantly missing days of shooting. Regardless of that, I gave the movie a watch today and while I can say that this is one of the better action blockbuster movies I've seen all year long, it is also one of the more generic action blockbuster movies that Hollywood loves putting out every single year.\n\nPositives for Red One (2024): There is some fun to be had with a movie about two guys saving Santa Claus and Christmas from the big bad villain. I liked Chris Evans as the main hacker/bounty hunter Jack O'Malley and while this is one the more stock characters that I've seen in a lot of other movies, he does a decent job here. There is some fun to be had seeing J. K. Simmons as Santa Claus and while I have my criticisms about his utilization, I still had fun with that side of the movie. For me, the best performance in this movie is easily Kiernan Shipka as she is having the time of her life as the main villain and she knows exactly what movie she is in and is holding nothing back. And finally, there are some fun action sequences involving Snowman and a talking Polar Bear that admittedly had me smiling throughout the movie.\n\nMixed for Red One (2024): The movie has the storyline with Chris Evans and the kid who is his son in the movie to where they have this difficult relationship with each other and they have to overcome it by the end of the movie. At the first, the kid was a little annoying, but he is thankfully not in the movie a lot, which also makes me question as to why they even bothered having this plotline in the movie to begin with.\n\nNegatives for Red One (2024): This is yet again another one of these generic big budget action blockbuster movies where it feels like the producers are spending too much money on a move that didn't need to have this big of a budget. While I did have fun seeing J. K. Simmons as Santa Claus, he's barely in the movie. Lucy Liu is also in the movie and she feels so out of place in the movie and is only here to show up when the plot needs her the most. Then, you have The Rock and he is literally just The Rock in this movie just like he is in every other movie that I've seen him in. At this point in his career, The Rock needs to start taking roles that will actually allow him to act and not have him playing his wrestling persona, you know something that John Cena and Batista have successfully done in their careers. I didn't laugh or smile at any of the humor in the movie and it feels like the humor that you would see in an MCU movie. And finally, the movie's climax is the typical and generic final battle where the main characters are fighting a CGI monster.\n\nOverall, if you like these types of movies, then you're goin to have fun with Red One (2024). I did have some fun with the mvie, I also wished that this movie did something else aside of the generic stuff that I've seen done better in other movies."", ""Despite the predicted box office failure and low critical ratings, the film was pleasantly surprised.\n\nA whole set of stars of the first magnitude, an interesting plot, characters, and I would like to highlight the prescribed universe separately.\n\nThe feature with changing the size of objects is used many times, but each time it manages to make you laugh.\n\nIt's even a shame that the New Year's blockbuster is coming out in November... And that's what the person in charge of the studio's release calendar was counting on.\n\nI recommend that you get acquainted closer to the new year. Not Home Alone with a Die Hard to review for the hundredth time?!"", ""Red One is a fun, action-packed Christmas movie that takes everything you know about Christmas lore and brings it to life in an imaginative way. At its core, the film revolves around the kidnapping of Santa Claus and the adventure to rescue him. It's a wild, entertaining ride that stands out in the growing list of action-oriented holiday movies.\n\nThe performances are solid, with Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans delivering a dynamic and entertaining duo. However, Chris Evans' character, Jack, could have benefited from a bit more development. That said, their chemistry and banter keep the film engaging as they navigate a world full of Christmas-inspired action and humor.\n\nThe movie balances its comedic moments, action sequences, and heartfelt scenes pretty well, making it a great choice for families, though it's primarily geared toward older teens. If you're looking for a festive film with a unique twist, Red One is definitely worth checking out."", ""There is no Christmas spirit here, just shameless corporate money making.\n\nAll characters are nothing to be related with. A divorced family. Father who is a thief both in digital as well analog world for the highest bidder and keeps his distance from his only son. The apple does not fall too far from the tree, and the boy is no role model either; quite the contrary.\n\nThings are not any better at the other end of the spectrum. Many of the Santa Claus' subordinates are both physically and verbally very aggressive. No happy little elves here, but a bunch of scary monsters.\n\nProduct placement is blatant. While the message the movie attempts to convey is that one should not land on a naughty list, the outcome of not being on one is just having more material wealth.\n\nMoreover, the writing has no nice tones or shades, and mood swings are extreme. At one point, the movie looks like a happy PG rated film but suddenly violence is queued in. As if the PG-13 rating is merely a mathematical average, a result of two scripts being put together. One, that was a traditional, targeted for the entire family and the other, which aims solely for R rating.\n\nOne has to ask: What does the headless horseman do in this movie? Better be just a leftover from otherwise scrubbed script, that was used to get some salary bonus (unlocked by over two hour runtime) and not an attempt to build yet another cinematic universe.\n\nAnd that is really the biggest problem. This movie is not really for anyone.\n\nFor the youngest audience this is much too scary. Teenagers likely find the subject is just too pampered, hormones and testosterone are not exactly oozing in this one. Finally, mature audiences, just like the very young ones, cover their eyes with hands. Not because this would be a horror movie, but because of the shame. Even if one leaves before the credits are rolled in, the fee was paid, and ultimately it financed an entity, that does not exactly make the world a better place (at least based on this release).\n\nTrue popcorn entertainment might not receive very high ratings on an absolute scale, but does not truly leave one unsatisfied.\n\nThis movie, however, provides no value other than making many of the existing Christmas themed, done nothing but paycheck in mind, movies look like masterpieces."", 'Went to see this Christmas film with family, had heard bad reviews online and from Mark Komode the film critic, but was pleasantly surprised and all the family thought it was a great Christmas film, recommend that kids over 10 years old watch it as Krampus may scare the younger kids. Some lovely warming quotes about adults trying to remember the meaning of Christmas and never doubting that Santa exists. Plenty of action scenes to keep the older kids interested and a heartwarming ending, for us as a family had everything needed for a Christmas film but just one thing missing as a family we all agreed that Jason Momoa would have made it even better if he would have played Krampus. But would definitely recommend.', ""I saw a few hours ago with my assistant Seth that was fun entertainment even if it was a little cheesy Red One is great holiday experience! Jake Kasdan directed a wild unique story that has action, pretty good comedy, and loads of Sci-Fi elements packed in. The Jumanji remakes were directed by Jake along with a couple other comedies so that's definitely cool cause those are awesome and all the fantasy stuff mashed into Red One was detailed quite well it was impressive a little surprised this bombed a bit. Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evan's and Jk Simmons were all great; pretty good wild ride would recommend!"", ""Do not watch if you actually value your time. It's so bad I'm actually offended someone made this movie and thought people would enjoy it.\n\nThe movie's biggest issue lies in its tonal confusion. It doesn't quite commit to being a festive family film, nor does it work as a gripping action flick. Instead, Red One awkwardly swings between genres, creating a story that's hard to invest in and frustrating to watch. While a Christmas action movie sounds fun in theory, this one lacks both the charm and the adrenaline needed to pull it off. It's almost like a 5 year old wrote the script.\n\nThe Rock was actually insane to think making this movie would be a good idea. The biggest disappointment however was Chris Evans's performance. Whatever happened to him lately? He used to be charismatic, but it feels like he's lost his charm and doesn't bring the same energy that made his previous performances memorable.\n\nThis film sure is another flop in his resume.\n\nThe action sequences are equally uninspired, often feeling generic and poorly choreographed. The stunts lack the precision and excitement that could have made this a memorable holiday action film. Combined with a bland storyline, Red One feels like a missed opportunity.\n\nIn the end, Red One is a disappointing addition to holiday movies, neither funny nor exciting enough to justify its premise. For fans of holiday classics or action-packed thrillers, this movie is best left unwatched."", ""Had a lot of fun elements, a little boring at times for the kids, but managed to make fun of the stereotypical holiday movies and still end like one, which I anticipated and didn't really mind. The kids enjoyed it overall, even with them still learning English and missing a lot of the jokes, it was a little scary at times for them, which they liked. The kids don't really believe in Santa Claus but they must have managed to peak my kid's interest since they asked pretty early on if this was real, and for a mom that have kids that don't believe Santa that was fun to hear since I want them to keep that innocence and Christmas magic as long as possible. It didn't feel like a holiday movie and this won't be a go to movie to get in the holiday spirit, but overall a fun movie for the family."", 'This year, I highly recommend the film ""Red One."" This cinematic masterpiece skillfully weaves together comedy, action, and suspense, creating an engaging and entertaining viewing experience. While the language may occasionally be humorous, it does disturb the overall enjoyment for Christian viewers. The film\'s production values are exceptional, with seamless filming, captivating characters, memorable music, and impressive special effects. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Christmas movies that is packed with all of the above, but for age, I would recommend ages 13 and above.', ""Full disclosure: I don't like the American tradition of Santa. It insults the memory of the real St. Nicholas and mocks the whole tradition of Christmas (both the Christian and the pagan side of it). That being said, I always enjoyed Santa Claus comedies (e.g. Violent night), for as long as they were fun.\n\nUnfortunately, the title of this review says it already. This production is too big, there are too many stars. There's a fine line between pushing boundaries and going too far. This movie went too far in taking itself seriously. At the same time, it's still ridiculous in many places.\n\nStill, it's a well crafted movie and I don't anything concrete to criticize here."", ""This film was such good fun, a lovely family cinema trip that got us in the festive spirit and had us all hooked from the beginning.\n\nGo in expecting what it is, a family popcorn action flick with a Christmas twist and you won't be disappointed!\n\nDwayne Johnson is awesome (as always) as is the rest of the cast, the story is good, It made us laugh, root for the good guys, and even had a few heartfelt moments too...what's not to like?\n\nThe story uses cultural fantasy figures as characters in the film and felt original and different, no mean feat when there are hundreds of Santa movies out there.\n\nIn short such a fun movie that I hope does well at the box office as its well deserved, a new found family favourite festive movie that will be added to our annual Christmas movie list."", 'North Pole Head of Security Callum Drift has to search for Santa Claus after he has been mysteriously kidnapped. Drift must team up with level four naughty lister Jack O\'Malley in order to track his whereabouts. The two men learn that they need to stop a greater evil who wants to make the world ""nicer,"" by targeting anyone who has ever been naughty.\n\nOh boy... let me start with a couple of positives. Chris Evans is by far the best part of the movie as he is the only main actor who looks like he is having any fun with this movie. He has a few fun moments and a somewhat heartfelt speech to his son. Evans is not amazing, but he is kind of fun to watch. Kristofer Hivju is pretty fun as Krampus and his makeup for the creature looks fantastic. It is by far the best looking part of the movie because of the interesting design and solid practical effects.\n\nSome of the technology in this movie is pretty cool, such as the guns that freeze people and the gadgets that can turn toys into life at a much bigger size. I really liked listening to some classic Christmas music especially the songs from Mariah Carey. It is so fun to listen to her versions of Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) on the big screen. The ending is really cool because it has the most Christmas spirit in the story. There is a scene where a guy gets possessed by the villain that made for some campy fun expressions and line delivery... yeah that\'s all I got.\n\nThis is a 250 million dollar Christmas themed blockbuster and all it had to do was be entertaining to watch. Red One is one of the ugliest and most joyless blockbusters I have seen in years. It also might be the worst movie I have seen in theaters over a decade. First of all, this movie is so ugly to look at in nearly every frame. For a Christmas movie, the colors look so drab and monochromatic not fitting the theme of the film at all. It looks like a bland made for TV movie for the most part. The CGI is not great and some of the creatures while they have cool designs look pretty fake. What really makes this movie look awful though is the lighting. It is one of the worst lit movies I have ever seen and it drags all of the visual aspects down. Not only does the lighting make the cinematography look even plainer than it already looks, but it is so dim-looking that it makes it harder to make out what is happening in the action scenes and visuals. There some really cool creature designs and makeup that are shown in the worst lit rooms.\n\nSpeaking of which, the action scenes are subpar at best. Some of them have a glimpse of fun with how they use the gadgets and how Cal and Jack defeat their enemies, but the fights are poorly shot and over-edited. The climax has some moments that look cool, but the lighting is so dim, it is hard to make out what is happening and to enjoy it. The first chase scene is laughably bad effects-wise and again with dim lighting. Even if you wanted to just watch this movie for some cool Christmas action, you will be disappointed with what the movie offers.\n\nThe story could have been this awesome Christmas spectacle with some heartwarming moments, clever use of Christmas mythology and Christmas cheer, but instead it is a bland cliched road-trip comedy with corny dialogue and a lot of scenes with Chris Evans and Dwayne Johnson talking in the car. It is an overlong quest to find Santa Claus with two unlikable people bickering at each other nonstop who only at best learn to tolerate each other. There are so many chances this movie has to show off some cool moments of Christmas mythology in fun ways and it wastes all of them except for the scene with Krampus.\n\nThe tone of the movie is really corny as I feel that this is a kids movie that got the PG-13 rating just to be a little edgy at times and to say a few curse words. The humor is very cringeworthy with only a couple lines of dialogue or gags making me chuckle at best. I think I may have a chuckled more at Madame Web than this. The bad comedy just makes this movie that already feels too long drag on even longer.\n\nThis movie has a solid cast but aside from Evans and Hivju, they either have bad performances or they are wasted. The Rock plays as the same character as he does in most of his movies, but he is oddly more unlikable and stoic here. Dwayne Johnson looks so bored to be here. Despite a lot of his excitement around the film in promos, it does not show in his acting here. It does not help that his character is nothing more than a boring plank of wood that exists to argue with Evans\' character. Even fans of The Rock will probably have a hard time enjoying him in this movie.\n\nI said Chris Evans is one of the few bright spots in the movie and I stand by that, but that is more for him as an actor than his character, Jack. Jack is not a likable protagonist at all to put it lightly. He is a terrible father who never shows care for his child until the plot requires it, he is dismissive towards pretty much every person he talks to and he is a criminal who only does the right thing because he is forced to. There are some sweet moments with this character and he has some of the funnier lines mainly because of Evans\' delivery, but he is overall not a likable or sympathetic protagonist.\n\nAnother problem with this movie is that Johnson and Evans have no on-screen chemistry. They always bicker and the banter is not witty or fun to watch. These two men seem like they would rather hang out with anyone else than each other. It does not help that one actor is playing as a plank of wood and the other is doing his best to make an unlikable character charismatic.\n\nOne my biggest complaints with this movie is how it unforgivably wastes J. K. Simmons as Santa Claus. Simmons is capable of turning any role into gold no matter how bad the material is, but this movie shoves him aside and gives him absolutely nothing to work with after the first ten minutes until the end. The worst part is that the few scenes with Simmons in it are really fun and kind of heartwarming, especially when he is chatting with kids at a store. Simmons could have saved this film if he had a bigger presence, but he is shoved aside for most of the movie. Why the hell would you even cast Simmons at this point if you are not gonna utilize him properly?\n\nAs for the rest of the cast, Lucy Liu phones it in as the director of M. O. R. A. in just about every scene she is in, but she does at least gets a cool fight in right before the climax. Bonnie Hunt as Mrs. Claus is okay, but she gets little to do. Garcia the Polar Bear seems like he would be a fun character, but he is barely in the film despite being heavily advertised. Then there is the villain played by Kiernan Shipka. Her motive is interesting on paper trying to punish anyone who has ever been naughty to make the world ""nicer."" The problem with this is that she ultimately becomes a bit generic in the final act and breaking free of the her punishment is a little too easy. Grýla is far from the worst villain I have seen, but she could have been so much better and Shipka\'s stiff performance does not do a whole lot for me.\n\nAlthough this movie has some nice Christmas tracks throughout the runtime, the musical score by Henry Jackman is rather unremarkable. It is not terrible, but there are no memorable tunes from the score. It feels like music I could hear in any other big budget film.\n\nWith such a big budget, interesting ideas and a star-studded cast, this should have been two hours of Christmas bliss. Instead, Red One takes the joy right out of the holiday. I cannot remember the last time I watched a movie in theaters with such a stone-faced reaction, but this made for one of the least enjoyable theater experiences I have ever had. I wanted to like this movie or at least say more positive things about it even if it was not my first choice to watch, but I cannot bring myself like it. I enjoyed Director Jake Kasdan\'s two Jumanji movies a lot so I have no idea what happened here. I would not even recommend it as background noise because I can think of so many movies that would be better to have on in the background than this. This is the kind of movie that would make any fan of Christmas say bah humbug!', 'I was unsure what to expect from ""Red One"" because I was lukewarm about its trailers. The film\'s budget of $250M also confuses me. I hope I\'m wrong, but it may flop because it\'s opening a week before the next Barbenheimer - ""Wicked"" and ""Gladiator II"" - and to a potential $36M in the US. I still went in with an open mind, yet kept expectations as low as possible. After seeing it in IMAX, no less, my first time with the format, I\'m happy to say it was better than I thought it would be.\n\nTo begin the positives, Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans did surprisingly well as mismatched-buddy duo Callum Drift and Jack O\'Malley, as the former ELF must team up with the latter tracker to rescue Santa Claus. I may never forgive The Final Boss for what he did to Cody Rhodes - the heel turn that single-handedly got me hooked on WWE, congrats - but I am still down for a Johnson vehicle, and this is no different. Post-Captain America Evans was likewise entertaining playing O\'Malley.\n\nThe legendary J. K. Simmons puts in an enjoyable performance as Santa Claus himself. Even though he is severely underutilized, whenever he is on screen, I can\'t help but feel the Christmas spirit, which I wasn\'t anticipating from this film at all.\n\nMany scenes showcased creative concepts regarding the typical Santa Claus lore, such as changing the size of toy cars into actual ones and portals in toy stores that lead to different locations. They may be conveniences on the surface, but I felt they were welcome inclusions.\n\nThe film was much funnier than I envisioned. Many jokes landed for me, whether simple exchanges or laugh-out-loud gags. One involving O\'Malley had me in stitches, and I want you to experience it for yourself.\n\nThe remaining positives include the visuals, the well-crafted action, and the ending sequence, which I felt was the best part of the movie, not to discredit the rest of the experience.\n\nWhile it was a fun ride, there are flaws I want to overlook, but I unfortunately can\'t. My main issue with this film is its villain, Gryla, played by Kiernan Shipka. She felt generic and wasn\'t that menacing, with a weak reason to steal Santa Claus.\n\nOther than that, since I don\'t want to over-critique this film, there were some tedious scenes. Luckily, the film immediately or shortly picks up, but I wish the movie had better pacing.\n\nOverall, ""Red One"" was a hard film to love but wildly enjoyable. Considering I doubted this movie, I was unprepared for how much fun I would have. It would be a shame if this film flopped, so this is my call to action for you to watch it in theaters.\n\nTechnically, it\'s a bit of a mess. The performances, visuals, and humor aside, the story is not the most compelling since it contains a weak villain and some equally weak character decisions. Additionally, a few moments were unintentionally hilarious, in a not-good way. However, it doesn\'t matter what I think. You don\'t go into a movie starring The Rock expecting a masterpiece. A technical score of 5/10 shouldn\'t matter.\n\nThe enjoyment score, on the other hand, is what you\'re reading this for. It\'s barrels of enjoyment, with great chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans, intriguing concepts, exciting action, and desirable humor. I can\'t overlook the flaws as much as I tried, but the enjoyment score remains a 7/10. It\'s PG-13 Christmas fun for the whole family!', 'LIKES:\n\nFunny Banter\n\nMoving Pace\n\nLittle References to Other Holiday Movies\n\nFun Mythological works\n\nDecent Acting\n\nCreative\n\nThe Krampus\n\nSurprisingly Heart Felt\n\nSUMMARY: The movie is a buddy comedy wrapped in a Christmas package and loaded with some fun and funny moments to start the season on the right foot. Evans and Johnson have great banter work in this film, trading metaphorical blows as they each try to work together to take point in the mission. A dry security expert and a lackadaisical hacker are two very different personalities that work well to give the buddy humor, and I liked the twist they brought to the holidays with it. I found myself laughing several times at the lines, clever puns, witty insults, and some well-timed deliveries all assisted with increasing the comedy. Even more impressive, the movie manages to pull in comedy for all ages, though a caution as there are some very adult references that your kids might imitate. Outside of the fun, the movie moves at an engaging pace, chewing through the two hours without difficulty as they try to investigate the depth of Santa\'s conspiracy. Red One manages to integrate mythology and modern times into a Percy Jackson adventure full of clever references and ingrained lore that surprisingly fit better than they should. I particularly enjoyed how the movie also seemed to patch together several references to previous Christmas movies into one film; each component hybridized into a recognizable homage that still had its unique traits. The whole film is quite creative and makes for entertaining, popcorn-munching quality that still is surprisingly heartfelt with the messages at hand. Yes, it gets a tad cheesy, but I have to say that Red One managed to modernize the message about Christmas and add just that new-age mentality without falling into the modern-day agenda other films have found.\n\nAs a section on itself, I give props to the acting in this film and the commitment they made to a very odd movie like Red One. Johnson is the same man he often is, in this case, the stoic, no-nonsense, brute-force hero with the mission in mind and nothing more. He plays the rugged ""action"" role well and does little to escape from the stereotype he has placed himself in. Evans also plays his typical range, this one more of that haphazard and aloof demeanor with only sarcasm and rogue fun to break through the façade. He will, of course, have some changes in the movie, but it\'s nothing new and perfect for the broad audience the movie is trying to appeal to for these primary ratings. Liu sort of falls back to her 90s roles again, never extending past her intense stares and very monotone emotion, which again fits the bill for the head of a government organization. She has a few moments to break through the hard-as-stone persona, but otherwise, you get another personality that meshes well with the energy of the movie. The Krampus, however, is probably the most unique and dynamic of the characters in this film. Kristofer Hivju brings fantastic energy with his vocal and non-vocal acting as the big baddie of Christmas. His delivery is top-shelf quality, owning the moment with how he embraces the darker emotions that come with the holidays. His costume and makeup work is some of the best of the bunch, with the group putting a lot of time and energy into crafting realistic costumes that I like in my movies and not compromising on the complexity of the character. I would have liked a lot more of this type of character, range, and creativity in other characters, but I at least got this gold nugget (alongside Simmons\' take on the Big Man himself).\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nAction Is Dialed Back\n\nThe Comedy Is A Little Flat\n\nCharacter Usage Is Uneven\n\nYou\'ve Seen A Lot In The Trailers\n\nNeeded A Little More Excitement\n\nSome Story Components Could Use Touching Up\n\nVisuals Are Inconsistent\n\nSummary: Red One\'s campiness is certainly fun and a fresher take on the Christmas holiday stories, but it still has some workshopping to help get the movie to the full spectacle they were trying to achieve. Despite the trailer promises, the movie is not the Die Hard of the new era. Many of the stunts are CGI runs, simplified punches, dives, and choreography that is very stiff and practiced with limited opposition that wasn\'t drowned out in montages. I found it funny how kid-friendly the action was, while the language was certainly not scaled back for the potential young audience members. And like the action, the comedy sometimes becomes a tad flat and stale by about the middle of the film. Fortunately, some of the other characters do the lifting, but it only helps so much to break up the cringe-inducing jokes that come at times. The character usage is bad in this film. Most of the characters were reduced to cameos, simple appearances, and some minor actions/moves that were fun but highly reduced from what I thought they were going to be in this film. Had they maybe integrated a few more characters and dove into their backstories or emotional depth, we might have gotten a movie that could help add more integration and stakes to the fight. Increase the action alongside the threat of the villain, and you could have further helped give this movie more vigor and excitement, I think they were going for in the design. I\'m not saying I needed vicious dismemberment or gory messes, but the world of Santa Claus offers a lot of potential for unique fighting and solutions that I think just didn\'t have the same level of creativity. And finally, the visuals are indeed inconsistent, as other reviews have mentioned. Sometimes, the movie makes things in stunning detail, like the Krampus or Garcia the polar bear, that are realistic as they can be outside of really good costumes. At other times, the special effects are back to the 2000s level, with the fake animation showing some budget cuts that could have been better utilized. It\'s not the worst by far, but... it\'s annoying to see such inconsistencies when this was a movie with a lot of backing.\n\nThe VERDICT: Red One has accomplished much in terms of being a new generational tradition in the holiday movie lineup. It\'s corny, campy, and overall fun, bringing a lot of comedic styles into the film and not apologizing for being the fast-paced festivity that it serves to be. A good leading cast helps to lift much of the writing, and the creativity is certainly something for the books and will touch a lot of hearts with the messages and references they make in this menagerie. True, the movie is not the action epic they promised, and the story needs more edge, time, and character balance to accomplish the lofty goals it south. Yet, the movie is still decent and fun enough to get out to the theater to see and enjoy the holiday spirit.\n\nMy scores for Red One are:\n\nHoliday/Mystery/Action/Satire/Comedy/Fantasy/Adventure: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall 7.0.', ""Absolutely waste of time, im not even joking when i say it was boring asf made me so sleepy in the cinema, im not even being biased bc i had 5 other friends that had the same opinion. Most of my friends are very strict when it comes to rating good movies, this was the biggest disappointment to the point they didnt hesitate saying it was a solid 1 out of 10 movie, for us teens this wasnt satisfying, i feel like this movie suits the elders or the kids. Half the movie through we left the cinema and we were so disappointed. They should pay us to watch tht movie. Can't believe we spent money on this film to watch at IMAX cinema plus we had snacks we paid for.\n\nI NEED MY REFUND FOR THE TICKETS </3."", ""We were looking ti kill some time, and decided to check out Red One. As someone who normally doesn't like Christmas movie, often because they can feel a bit predictable, this one was a pleasant surprise. It takes a familiar holiday theme and adds a fresh, exciting twist that really works for someone like me who doesn't like this sort of movie.\n\nEven though I'm a bit of a cynic when it comes to holiday films, Red One struck the perfect balance. It offers a fun, lighthearted Christmas experience, but with just enough depth to keep things interesting for the adults too.\n\nThe movie has a great vibe for kids, while still managing to sneak in a few clever moments for the grown-ups. So, if you're looking for a family-friendly holiday flick, this is definitely a good pick. It might not change your outlook on life, but you'll definitely find yourself looking at Santa in a whole new way, especially when it comes to his impressive weightlifting skills!"", 'Red one is a okej movie if you have nothing to do and you live next to your theater.\n\nThe good: some funny jokes, there is some action, the rock and number 4 (was that not his old superstar name?) have some chemistry together. It is a bit the same like in jumanji only there you had Kevin Hart. It would be the main reason to watch this movie, some funny scène with the brother of santa.\n\nThe bad: way to much green screen, i think the whole movie is shot in the studio, which makes it... A bit cringe to watch. Why does all of the hollywood studios over do this? The evil female (totally miscast), a lack of people or elves in the northpole (the whole city is empty on christmas night what the hack?), feels fake, feels not real, doesnt come close to the authentic christmas feelings you can have with classic christmas movies of 20years ago.', '7/10\n\nRed One is pure entertainment. It knows what it is, leans into it, and doesn\'t try to be anything else. Movies like this are a rarity these days-a fun, self-aware story that\'s well-executed without taking itself too seriously. Think The Toxic Avenger or other classics that knew they were dumb fun and embraced it. That\'s Red One, and it absolutely works.\n\nWhat sets this movie apart is its solid storytelling. There are no plot holes that leave you scratching your head or logical inconsistencies that pull you out of the experience. Everything in Red One fits together in a way that makes sense for the world it creates. It\'s entertaining because it\'s well-written, even though it\'s a ""bad"" movie by traditional standards. That\'s the magic: it\'s a good bad movie, and it knows how to deliver on every level.\n\nThis isn\'t just a movie for kids, either. It\'s got plenty for parents to enjoy, too, from clever humor to genuinely heartfelt moments. It tells a wholesome story without being preachy, making it a perfect family film that\'s actually enjoyable for everyone.\n\nIt\'s frustrating to see some modern audiences trashing this movie. People seem to have forgotten what it means to just sit back and be entertained. Not every movie needs to be some deep, artistic exploration of the human condition. Sometimes, a film just needs to make you smile, and Red One nails that. Pure escapism.\n\nIf you\'re tired of agenda-driven, over-serious films that forget to actually entertain, Red One is a breath of fresh air. It\'s unapologetically fun, smartly written, and a reminder of why we love movies in the first place.', ""The film introduces Santa Claus in a novel narrative.

It is a family-friendly movie with an engaging storyline that is sure to keep viewers entertained."", 'This is an honest review of the premiere of ""Red One"" and my experience as a fan. You will encounter many reviews claiming that the movie is great, but I found the writing to be mediocre. The dialogue between Chris Evans and The Rock was predictable. This is a movie I would definitely wait to watch until it hits Amazon or another streaming service. Some of the scenes were good, while others were lackluster. The writing could have been significantly better.\n\nThe performances of the cast were okay. Obviously, J. K. Simmons is outstanding in anything he does, and let\'s not forget Lucy Liu; she is always a stunning and talented actress. Honestly, their talents were the only things that saved this movie. The Rock delivered the familiar action we expect from him, but his performance felt like every other film he has done. I do have to admit that his good looks and personality do shine through.\n\nNow, let\'s talk about Mr. Chris Evans. I had high hopes for him since he was fantastic in ""Gifted,"" ""Knives Out,"" and ""Defending Jacob."" However, I have been disappointed with his recent work. I believe the movie should have cast someone with better comedic timing or at least a bit better acting skills. Five or six years ago, this movie would have made a lot of money simply due to his loyal fanbase, but many fans have been turned off by his recent personal choices, which I won\'t delve into.\n\nI feel that since entering his 40s, he is uncertain about what roles suit him. I also believe he has become complacent and is not pushing himself as he used to. Perhaps it\'s the people he associates with that have influenced him negatively; he seems to be only half the man he once was. Remember, this is a man who told GQ he wanted to retire, smoke some weed, and look at trees, which definitely reflects in his acting. He doesn\'t seem to have anyone around to remind him that if you retire or slack off, you may become irrelevant.\n\nNow, let\'s discuss the overall experience once you acquire a pass and head to the promotional call. You must stay in a long line, which took over two hours. We were told to dress business casual or fancier, and some attendees were actually more dressed up than I was. After waiting for more than two hours, we were seated in a packed theater. The cast was mixed in with the audience, which felt quite humbling. The Rock and the producer made an introduction, thanking the audience for showing up but not acknowledging those who endured the long wait.\n\nOnce the movie was over, the cast left immediately, and there was no Q&A session or any interaction with the audience. They did provide us with some water, popcorn, and candy, but honestly, I spent over two hours on my feet just to watch a movie I could have easily waited to see at the theaters or, better yet, on a streaming service.\n\nYou may argue that the cast did give fans autographs and photos, but there were many more fans waiting in the sidelines who didn\'t get to see them. This experience has shown me that some celebrities don\'t seem to care for their fans; they only care about the money. Honestly, these celebrities are not better than anyone else; they just make more money, and quite frankly, some of them don\'t deserve it.\n\nIf you are considering watching this movie, I suggest you don\'t waste your money. You are not missing anything. If you want to enjoy a good Christmas movie, just watch ""Elf.""', '""Red One"" is a fantastic Christmas movie that truly captures the holiday spirit with a fresh twist.

Whether you\'re looking for action-packed sequences, moments of heartfelt connection, or just some good old holiday fun, this movie delivers on every front.\n\nIf you\'re searching for a fresh addition to your Christmas movie lineup, Red One is absolutely worth a watch.

I was quite impressed with the special effects, I personally thought that side of this flick looked pretty neat.\n\nDwayne Johnson and Chris Evans are fun enough in this. Johnson is a bit more serious than usual and I liked that, while Evans' character ends up being the heart of the movie. J. K. Simmons, more than Johnson, plays against type, it's actually unnerving seeing him portray a true good guy - was almost waiting for him to shout down someone's neck, as per.\n\nKiernan Shipka is decent, as is Kristofer Hivju - I rate their characters. Lucy Liu is underused, mind. Bonnie Hunt too, I guess. I can't really fault anyone from the cast though, they all do solid work. If I'm honest, I don't see this film having much of a lifespan in the old memory bank but, nevertheless, I'd still classify it as something worth viewing."", ""Don't listen to the Rotten Tomato critics, like most in the corporate media pundit class now a days, they're wrong about almost everything. The disparity in rotten tomatoes reviews symbolizes coastal elite critics as the soulless corporate ghouls vs the rest of America yearning for good.

Sure, coastal elite critics, it's not Oscar winning and I rolled my eyes a couple of times as I caught on. But it delivered positive messages, it aimed to be pure of heart, provided redemption, faith in family, a little humor and normal feel good Christmas values, embedded into a don't take yourself so seriously action packed movie of fantasy and wonder. It's not that serious.

This hilarious, innovative film has a power cast that includes Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans, J. K. Simmons, Lucy Liu, Kiernan Shipka and more. It is full of action-packed adventure and comedy.\n\nThe storyline follows Jack O\'Malley (Chris Evans), a thief who sells information on the black market. Unknowingly, a mysterious buyer recruits Jack to give up Santa Claus\'s whereabouts. The buyer kidnaps Santa, aka the Red One (J. K. Simmons), and plans to cancel Christmas by punishing everyone on the naughty list. Santa\'s bodyguard, Callum Drift (Dwayne Johnson), recruits Jack O\'Malley to recover Santa before Christmas morning. It\'s up to Callum and Jack to save Christmas.\n\nRed One has an incredible ensemble cast, including some of Hollywood\'s biggest stars. Dwayne Johnson brings his signature humor, heart, and action to the magical, larger-than-life role of Callum Drift. Chris Evans\'s sharp wit and undeniable chemistry with Dwayne Johnson make their unlikely partnership a movie highlight. The memorable performances of J. K. Simmons, Lucy Lou (Zoe), Kiernan Shipka (Gryla), Wesley Kimmel (Dylan), Kristofer Hivju (Krampus), Bonnie Hunt (Mrs. Claus) and Mary Elizabeth Ellis (Olivia) create a holiday adventure like no other. The director, Jake Kasdan, infuses the holiday movie genre with fresh, new, festive, funny, and heartwarming energy. He balances the high-octane action scenes with some tender moments, producing a fun and unforgettable holiday movie. The imaginative characters of Red One are brought to life through the film\'s CGI and costumes, which create an engaging, whimsical story packed with excitement.\n\nRed One embraces the holiday spirit. The film\'s message is that everyone deserves a second chance and that you should always look for the good in people. Jack O\'Malley becomes an unexpected hero by turning around his past. He gets a second chance to help save Santa and become a better dad. Even with all the action scenes, Red One highlights the importance of family and friends and cherishing those relationships.\n\nI give Red One 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, adults. Red One opens in theaters on November 15, 2024. By Calee N., KIDS FIRST!', 'RED ONE is not merely a bad movie-it\'s a warning sign for where we are as a society. Its commitment to a ridiculous premise and overblown execution isn\'t bold, isn\'t ironic. It\'s symptomatic of a culture that mistakes bombast for creativity and cynicism for charm.\n\nThe film\'s lame attempt at parody feels less like a clever deconstruction and more like an excuse to churn out a corporate checklist disguised as a holiday spectacle. Borrowing liberally (and lazily) from every generic ""Save Xmas"" trope, it drenches the audience in saccharine sentimentality while simultaneously pandering to the notion that bigger, louder, and Rockier equates to better. The result is a garish, crass experience designed to appeal to viewers who demand nothing more from their entertainment than bright colors and inane one-liners.\n\nEven the attempts at unique characterization fail to elevate the movie. J. K. Simmons as a ""gym bro"" Santa feels less like a clever twist and more like an ill-advised pitch meeting gone awry. Lucy Liu\'s performance is wasted on a trope-riddled role, avec an awful wig, reminding us that even talented actors can\'t save a script devoid of originality. The motivations of the antagonist, Gryla, may aim for depth, but the narrative is so weighed down by its absurd premise that any potential nuance is flattened into trite moralizing.\n\nThe world-building, which some may praise as inventive, is more accurately described as nonsensical filler. The militarized North Pole and pseudo-technological Santa operation are bloated, joyless pro-gun distractions. Any charm or whimsy is sacrificed on the altar of CGI spectacle and overcomplicated logistics.\n\nPerhaps most damning is the film\'s central message, which ostensibly espouses the idea that there\'s ""good in everyone."" How original. But beneath its shiny, feel-good surface lies a disheartening undertone: the glorification of simplistic redemption arcs and facile moral equivalencies. It\'s a worldview that panders to audiences willing to overlook harmful complexities for the sake of shallow resolution, much like they might overlook the failings of a charismatic leader with dangerous authoritarian tendencies.\n\nIn the end, RED ONE isn\'t just a movie; it\'s a cultural artifact of a society that values distraction over substance and spectacle over thought. It\'s the Xmas gift no one needed but everyone somehow deserves, a flashy reminder that the bar for entertainment (and democracy) has plummeted to a depressing low. Anyone who finds joy in this film might want to ask themselves why they\'re so comfortable with mediocrity, and what that says about the state of the world we\'re living in.', ""I watched red one today and it was a very fun movie before i watched it, it felt like a netflix movie with all the big names and a cheesy trailer.\n\nI was surprised on how they made a movie that was so fun and it felt as if it had to same humor as home alone and a little bit of elf. Although it was cheesy at times and it felt clunky sometimes it was still enjoyable and a fun easy watch. For the budget i felt like they could have done more with it the CGI wasn't amazing and the movie visually didn't feel like an expensive movie it wasn't horrible it just wasn't great.\n\nThe acting for a comedy was good and the jokes were pretty good but i was expecting a bad humor duo with Chris evan's and the rock but they actually didn't overdue it like a crappy cash grab i feel like as if this movie was actually trying to be a soild Christmas movie and in my opinion it did.\n\nIn conclusion i feel as if this is a very fun watch and recommend watching it with a group of friends for some Christmas fun in the theaters although flawed, you have to remember to watch it as a comedy and not really action more like a mix of both, it was still a good movie and worth the watch."", ""For me this was a fun movie. For all of you who would like to spend 2 hours of fun and light moments without burdening yourself emotionally then go for it. Ignore any negative commentary or reviews because it's not that bad choice to spend two hours of your day during this holiday. Movie runs at a good pace. For me personally two hours went by fairly quickly. Santa is pumping iron because he is trying to stay fit to be able to deliver gifts to the entire child population across the world in s single night. Quite interesting take. Some funny lines peppered through the movie similar to Hobbs and Shaw."", ""This is one of the worst movies I've ever sat through.

Obvious it was chopped to bits with sporadic cuts and inconsistent placing of CGI characters and actors. I used to think Evan's was decent actor but the voice he's using is all over the place. Simmons is a very poorly crafted Santa, but even he's sleeping though it.\n\nI hate this movie. I hate how it made me feel while watching it. I hate how it's occupying space from another perfectly acceptable holiday movie. I hate continuing this awful movie machine of crap.\n\nThere's no point in being original if you don't have heart."", ""Once in a while, I love to watch ither a fantasy or even a ci-fi Something out of this world Not possible to happen Because there is no limit if the thing you write about does not exist the first word you write about it you get out of the frame It helps me to just relax and enjoy the the imagination of the writer Then the idea of saving Christmas from the evil witch who wants to punish the kids on the nutty list is very joyful to see Seeing how in every lost adult the little kid inside them makes us feel them and want to help them\n\nIt's a wonderful idea with course great acting from all the cast\n\nMy family genre movie of the year."", ""I'm going to try and get through this without any spoilers. I went in to this movie knowing it probably won't be good. I had the idea that it would be funny and entertaining and that's what I expected. 20 minutes into the film I found myself really intrigued by the story and got into it. Then the film became a little wonky and mythological, which you see a little bit of in the trailer. It took a turn that I wasn't expecting and really went with it. Wasn't a bad thing, just not expected. I feel Chis Evans and Dwayne Johnson do amazing jobs and I loved their characters. The pacing of the movie was very nice and there was a good spread of action and humor throughout. One consistent problem was the CGI in some areas, especially during action sequences. I understand there was a lot of CGI put into the movie and some areas required less work than others, but it took me out of the story and action when I notice that stuff. Overall, I think it's a good watch and at least somewhat enjoyable to most viewers."", 'I went into this movie not quite sure what to expect, but I was blown away with the results. It was actually a great Christmas movie with a good modernized spin on it. I also really loved JK Simmons as Santa Claus, I honestly feel he gave the movie that more action/violent feel kind of like David Harbour in his portrayal of Santa. My only true issue with this movie is that they kind of stray away from the main plot of Santa being captured, and focused more on the villain of the film. Then again that is my opinion, but that is just what I thought all throughout the film. However the actors were great, Rocky Maivia (Dwayne Johnson) as the main protagonist and Chris Evans as the comic relief was great. So overall I definitely recommend going to see the movie and it is a fun Christmas film I look forward to watching this time of year in years to come.', ""As in A list people involved in this? Or can you figure out what I did there? And I just came up with it - for my no pun intended collection as always. A fun movie to watch - in cinemas or somewhere else.

Like really hard - magic being done in public places and other stuff that do not make much sense.\n\nThe actors have fun doing whatever they are doing - this being a Warner Bros movie the actor formerly known as Captain America has to pretend he loves Wonder Woman ... light fun for everyone, no one should feel offended by this! Deadpool had a way crazier Superman stab/joke, so let's just enjoy movies like this without over analyzing.\n\nSimmons bulked up for this by the way - he impressed The Rock ... though it does not even seem to have been that necessary ... amount of screen time and all that.

Simmons) is kidnapped, North Pole security chief Callum Drift (Dwayne Johnson) must team up with hacker Jack O' Malley (Chris Evans), who is on the naughty list because of his hacker history. Together they must track down Santa Claus before Christmas Eve.\n\nFor an early Christmas film, there are far too many different things happening with too many characters, which quickly makes it difficult to follow. The story was also conceived by a novice writer for whom this is only his first film story. Furthermore, the screenplay was more developed by someone who has also done this for Fast & Furious films. This film therefore seems a bit like an exaggerated Fast & Furious Christmas film.\n\nWith Fast & Furious films, you actually don't have to think carefully about the story and everything else that happens in the film. It is a bit strange that this film asks you to listen to the story more, so that you can roughly know what is happening. Yet the writers themselves sometimes seem to have just done something to move the story forward. Because of this contradiction, you can suffer from brain freeze if you try to keep up with everything. All this messiness can also quickly make the film long-winded. With a playing time of just over two hours, this can be quite a long sit for some.\n\nIt is also unclear for which audience this film is intended. The audience can enjoy the exaggerated action, but the rest of the story and humor sometimes seem more intended for adults and then again for children.\n\nThe visual effects may still be entertaining and credible for younger viewers, but older viewers can quickly see the CGI and green screen, which can quickly lose credibility for them.\n\nThe acting is also not special. Dwayne Johnson plays a standard character again, which he also plays in many of his other films. A heroic type who tries to save everything undefeatably. Dwayne himself was a bit erratic during filming, which caused the film to be released later than planned and thus increased the budget. Dwayne himself managed to make 50 million of the budget his own.\n\nChris Evans tries to portray more of a comic hacker, but does not get enough space for this. J. K. Simmons also plays more of a cameo role, because after Santa Claus is kidnapped, he is not seen much in the film until the end."", 'Red One was very entertaining... it is not easy to develop one more plot about Santa Claus, but the movie delivers. Although Gryla, Krampus and the ""evil"" characters might be too much, Callum (Dwayne Johnson) and Jake (Chris Evans) are their own fun selves in their characters. But to us, the best part of the movie is the great creativity idea behind how Santa does all of his job in one night...! The way he manages to make all gifts and himself so small to fit everywhere with the help of elfs, and how he turns back it is A-MA-ZING, and from out point of view it has been one of the best (if not the best one) representation and explanation of Santa\'s job around the world in one night... you cannot wait for an Oscar awards movie, but you can have a great holiday family time enjoying Red One! Don\'t fall into its bad reviews, give it a try and enjoy it with your inner kid!', 'Delightfully up tempo and blessedly devoid of the usual narcissistic political rhetoric of Hollywood, ""Red One"" hands us the age-old, reliable modern-American spin on Santa and his merrymen. Despite some exposition, ""Red One"" delivers on the timely issue of a worldwide rise in naughtiness, a troubling reality both kids and grownups can relate to!\n\nA massively expensive endeavor (given the pedigree of the cast and the quality of the effects), ""Red One"" can\'t possibly be expected to turn a profit, so the aims of its release are obviously otherwise. This movie will stream on five different providers and release at a theatre near you. It would have been nice to see Chris Evans and the Rock attempt to, in some small degree, adopt some semblance of character acting, but sadly, no. Despite not being memeable, ""Red One"" adds its own details to the storied mythology of Christmas, and is best watched with young family and friends. And a large buttered popcorn.', ""It's a movie that's neither good nor terrible, just mediocre.\n\nDwayne Johnson plays Dwayne Johnson in a story that, unlike cases like Jumanji, doesn't gain anything from the actor staying in his comfort zone.\n\nChris Evans, despite some good roles in the past, with each passing year, these roles become a blur in my memory, with the actor falling into the same trap of playing the same character in every movie.\n\nI had high hopes for J. K Simmons or Lucy Liu, but unfortunately, no one stands out.\n\nThe main villain is revealed in a crude and poorly elaborated way, and you find yourself wondering which villain would be interesting in this story instead of the one we see.\n\nThe dramatic moments are clumsy as they try to build a narrative about family that doesn't seem to belong to the story, despite being a Christmas movie.\n\nRed One can be summed up as: A huge waste. Not only of cast, but also of budget and ideas.\n\nEven though it's an action movie, it doesn't get your blood pumping and being a Christmas movie, it doesn't warm your heart."", ""Really nice and good Christmas movies have become a bit scarce in recent years. We don't mean movies with a Christmas theme, but really movies that revolve around Christmas and Santa Claus. Fortunately, Red One is now there and the film even has a decent cast that can be featured on the poster. For example, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson plays in it. Johnson made his name in the WWE wrestling show, but nowadays he is an indispensable part of the Hollywood film landscape. The muscle man is one of the best paid actors in Hollywood today and often a guarantee for success when his name is added to the cast. In addition to Johnson, we see Chris Evans, who most will know as Captain America. But names such as Lucy Liu, J. K. Simmons and Bonnie Hunt also grace the film. The director is Jake Kasdan, who together with Johnson also successfully directed Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) and Jumanji: The Next Level (2019). So brace yourself for a lot of special effects, humor and a lot of action.\n\nYes, the film is fun, but unfortunately it follows a standard concept. This makes the film quite predictable, but hey, who else will pay attention to that. Santa Claus is kidnapped and no one seems to know who did it, well, no one?... Master thief and detective Jack O'Malley does. Together with Callum Drift he travels all over the world to find the mysterious kidnapper. This happens in a funny way, because they can travel easily and quickly because every toy store is connected to each other with a portal. Once they arrive in Aruba, where Christmas has a summery appearance, Callum and Jack get into a fight with a number of giant snowmen, something that is already given away in the trailer, but ultimately provides a lot of entertainment. In any case, it ensures that there is a lot of pace in the film and that you as a viewer do not have to be bored for a second. The story has little else to it, but because it is a seasonal film of course, this film will probably come back every year and in principle it is fun enough for that.\n\nEventually, the connection is even made between Santa Claus and Krampus, where Jack and Callum even have to go, something that perhaps provides the most entertaining scene in the film. Towards the end, it all becomes a pretty standard course and it makes it clear that this is not going to be a real Christmas classic. The fact that the film storms the cinemas at the beginning of November is somewhat striking. Maybe this is different in America, but here in the Netherlands we are often not even concerned with the Christmas holidays, except for a few garden centres. It also makes you feel that this film was released far too early. On the other hand, it could of course also be a clever trick to get the film on a streaming service around Christmas and give it a home entertainment release. In any case, it feels a bit unnatural to watch such an atmospheric Christmas film now.\n\nRed One is a fun Christmas film that may be storming the cinemas a little too early. With a little under two hours, you won't be bored anywhere and the pace is great. The chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans is great and the two provide a lot of humor in the film. J. K. Simmons plays Nick, as Santa Claus is called in the film and although this is not the first name you would think of, you do of course have a name on board who knows how to make the role his own and does so. For those who are already busy with Christmas and want to get in the mood, a trip to the cinema is definitely worth it. For those who want to wait until after Sinterklaas, the film will have been released on a streaming service by then. Don't expect a film that will become a classic, but one that will entertain you to the max."", ""This movie hits on a bunch of different levels. In fact they were able to pull a bunch of different ideas into one movie pretty well. Some ideas are traditional and some were new and original. One thing that ruined the movie a bit for me was the foul language. It doesn't belong in a holiday movie, it doesn't belong in most movies. Foul language is lazy and over used. It distracts rather than adds to the content. Its an old idea that its cool to swear. Its not, you just seem uneducated. If they traded all the swear words out for alternative creative language, i would have given the movie a 9 and recommended the movie to friends and family. When making a movie KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE.

While the film keeps you on edge for most of its runtime, the plot begins to fizzle out in the final act.\n\nHugh Grant delivers a standout performance, with Sophie Thatcher and Cloe East also shining in their roles. The director, cinematographer, and set designer deserve credit too, as they gradually immerse you into the growing madness of Grant's character and his eerie home.\n\nUnfortunately, the plot is the film's weakest point. The tension and mystery build beautifully at first, but around the two-thirds mark, it starts to unravel. The climax left me slightly underwhelmed, as I was expecting something more profound. Still, 'Heretic' is an excellent horror film in its own right - enjoyable, but not quite as memorable as I had hoped."", ""Hugh Grant ventures into the dense world of theological debate, tackling themes rarely covered on mainstream film. The film is undeniably intriguing, pulling viewers into complex discussions that feel both timeless and urgent. Yet, as I watched, I found myself grappling with an elusive question: was The Heretic a compelling film or merely an ambitious attempt that fell short?\n\nGrant's performance is engaging, but there's an intangible quality missing, something that keeps the movie from fully resonating. Perhaps it's Grant himself, who doesn't quite shed his familiar charm to embody a character steeped in philosophical conflict. Alternatively, it might be the script, which seems torn between delivering an engaging story with a profound message and indulgent lecture through Grant as the medium. This identity crisis leaves the film feeling somewhat ungrounded, making The Heretic a fascinating watch but ultimately difficult to categorise as either wholly successful or lacking.\n\nThe supporting cast did an excellent job in quite difficult roles for them to play alongside Grant as the lead."", 'What the hell is Hugh doing here? Hugh doesn\'t belong here...\n\nOr maybe, just maybe, Hugh does belong here! Maybe horror is Hugh\'s true calling, and did he waste 30 years of his career on romantic comedies! That\'s an exaggeration, of course, and I still love most of his silly rom coms. Fact is, though, that Hugh Grant gives away a perplexing performance as the disturbing and terrifying villain in ""Heretic"".\n\nThere\'s a lot more about Scott Beck & Bryan Wood\'s ""Heretic"" that deserves praise and attention! I didn\'t expect a horror script full of theological enquiries and debates, and I most certainly didn\'t expect that I would be so fascinated by the subject! Perhaps it\'s purely thanks to Hugh Grant\'s uncanny charisma as Mr. Reed, and the way he intimidates and petrifies two innocent young Mormon girls that show up on his doorstep, but the more talkative ""Heretic"" became, the more I loved it. Reed is like an eloquent big bad wolf, preying on two cherubic but naïve Little Red Riding Hoods. It\'s an absorbing thriller spectacle that keeps you gazing at the screen with amazement for half the film. And you know what\'s most intriguing? Many things Reed says about various aspects of religion make total sense!\n\nWhen ""Sisters"" Barnes and Paxton are lured into Reed\'s eerie basement, ""Heretic"" maneuvers into more familiar and grotesque territory. Theory is put into practice and verbal terror turns into physical horror, which somehow makes the film less unique. Some action was necessary, I reckon, and luckily ""Heretic"" remains entertaining and suspenseful throughout.\n\nPS: the link with Radiohead\'s ""Creep"" in the first couple of lines isn\'t coincidental. The film makes great use of the brilliant song, as well as of ""The Air that I Breath"" by The Hollies.', '""Very thought provoking"", I thought to myself, at least 15 minutes into the movie. Heretic came from out of the blue, which shows how much my awareness has been with the movie industry lately. Needless to say, we went to see it on opening night, just to get out of the house.\n\nThere\'s definitely some good acting going on here, but I cannot say enough about Hugh Grant. He\'s outstanding and handled this role with deft. The unpredictability and suspense had me on the edge of my seat. I\'ve never been much for these type films until now. Believe me, Heretic was well written and quite intriguing. You don\'t want to miss it.', ""If like me you watched this movie because you wanted to see Hugh Grant play a creepy villain, then you won't be disappointed.\n\nHeretic is the story of 2 young Mormons visiting the house of Mr Reed, Played by Hugh Grant. However, things aren't what they seem.\n\nOut the gate, you meet the 2 Mormon's, Sister Barnes played by Sophie Thatcher and Sister Paxton player by Chloe East. For me personally, I came into this movie for the Hugh Grant show, but these 2 actresses held their own and both gave a great performance. With this movie only really consisting of 3 characters, it's important that 2/3rds of the cast deliver, and they did! Sophie Thatcher's character, Sister Barnes, I'd say is the more in-depth of the 2 Mormons and is the more experienced of the 2. Chloe East's character, Sister Paxton, who is the newer missionary who feels like more of a believer than her counterpart and is eager to convert and spread the word of God. Both their performances mainly consist of being terrified of Mr Reed and fortunately neither fall into the dumb protagonist trope.\n\nNow for Mr Reed, played by Hugh Grant. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly how Hugh Grant plays this character so well. Because the way he acts isn't innately creepy or scary in any way. It's more of a case of context that makes Mr Reed creepy. The way he delivers his dialogue is so calm and, in a way, like he's giving a lecture. Which he is. He's trying to educate and enlighten the 2 Mormons. The way Mr Reed gave me the ick was the way he's condescending and speaks down to you. That and the fact we're in a strange spooky house, where the lights are on a timer and the ceiling is dripping. Mr Reed just feels off!\n\nAbove I mentioned the dialogue. Writers/Directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods wrote Heretic beautifully. Giving each character their own identity through their dialogue. Heretic had great cinematography with effective use of close ups and panning shots.\n\nSounds design was simple yet effective. The sound of creaking floorboards, drips, and old metallic locks and doors really punctuated the idea of this being an old rustic house.\n\nNow this is a spoiler free review, so I'm not going to discuss this part too much, but one aspect of the movie I wish they'd explore more of was the idea of the labyrinth. The figurines and the model labyrinth are featured in the poster and the movie trailer but aren't all that important in the movie. So, if you were expecting a horror like labyrinth movie, then I'd be disappointed. That being said, the set was quite minimal, not much to really discuss. But what was there was simple and effective.\n\nThe key theme of Heretic is religion and belief. This movie does a great job at showing both sides of the coin without feeling like it's favouring or attacking one opinion over another. It managed that balancing act well, which is important, as to not feel like it's attacking its audience's point of views or believes.\n\nI will say that I didn't think the movie was that scary. That doesn't bother me much, but it was released around Halloween and was advertised to be a horror movie, so that may affect your enjoyment of the movie, depending on what you were expecting. I'd say it leans more into the thriller mystery elements, which is more my cup of tea.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Heretic. Didn't feel too long and went at a brisk pace."", 'Founded in 2012, production and distribution company A24 has become synonymous with quality. Generally, if a film or TV show bares the A24 logo, it is worth watching, and probably made by an auteur. The likes of Jonathan Glazer, Denis Villeneuve and Sofia Coppola have partnered with the company, to brilliant results. A24 is also now associated with- what some refer to as- ""elevated horror,"" which, despite the pretentious title, basically refers to a horror movie that\'s actually good.\n\nFrom Robert Eggers\' \'The Witch\' and \'The Lighthouse,\' to Ari Aster\'s \'Midsommar\' and Alex Garland\'s \'Men\', A24 has consistently delivered original horror films that don\'t just scare, but explore deeper themes, evoking a sense of dread that lingers long after the credits roll. Their latest horror offering, \'Heretic,\' follows two Mormon missionaries, Sisters Barnes and Paxton, who find themselves in mortal danger after visiting the home of Mr. Reed, a reclusive Englishman. Does it live up to the A24 standard?\n\nFor the most part, it does. Written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, \'Heretic\' is a suspenseful exploration of faith, fear and the unknown. An unsettling, sinister atmosphere is fostered for the first two acts, and one is unsure in what direction proceedings are heading. It\'s also got a little bit of dark-humour, mainly in the demeanour and dialogue of the Reed character; whose good nature and charm mask a hidden darkness.\n\nMoreover, Reed\'s monologues about religion raise genuinely interesting points, exploring the conflicts between faith and doubt, and the struggle to reconcile belief with the harsh realities of the world. His comparisons between religion, boardgames and popular music are especially provocative, challenging the protagonists- as well as the audience- to reflect on their own beliefs and the societal structures surrounding them.\n\nThe narrative engages throughout, though loses steam in the third act, where things boil down to a predictable riff on classic horror tropes. While the initial buildup is masterful, the resolution feels somewhat rushed and less impactful compared to the film\'s earlier intricacies. This slight dip in momentum, however, doesn\'t overshadow the film\'s overall success.\n\nVisually, \'Heretic\' is stunning. Chung-hoon Chung\'s haunting cinematography ably captures the eerie isolation of Reed\'s home, creating an atmosphere that is both beautiful and eerie. Chung\'s use of extreme-close-ups heightens the film\'s ominous atmosphere, as does his utilisation of light and shadow. Furthermore, Philip Messina\'s intricate production design is arresting; the contrasting interiors of Reed\'s home being highly impressive artistically, while also speaking to the development of Reed as a character.\n\nInitially, Reed\'s house appears quaint and unremarkable, much like the man himself. As the plot progresses and the Sisters venture further into his home, it undergoes a metamorphosis, becoming grander and more imposing, before sinking into base seediness. This transformation not only serves to heighten the tension but also symbolizes the unveiling of Reed\'s true nature; a canny piece of visual storytelling.\n\nIn addition, Chris Bacon\'s original score enhances the film\'s ominous tone, keeping viewers on edge, while he makes clever use of music from the likes of The Hollies and Radiohead, with the latter\'s \'Creep\' being used to particularly strong effect. It is also a well-edited picture, rocketing along at a brisk pace (and feeling a lot shorter than an hour and fifty minutes).\n\nHugh Grant stars as Reed, and has arguably never been better. The character is a far cry from the charismatic rom-com heroes he\'s best known for, and he seems to really enjoy playing such a creep. Although over the last few years he has played quite a few villains- from a cannibal in \'Cloud Atlas\' to a billionaire arms dealer in \'Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre\'- few have been as calculating and as cruel as Reed. With a mischievous, menacing twinkle in his eye, Grant steals every scene.\n\nChloe East and Sophie Thatcher star opposite him as Sisters Paxton and Barnes, respectfully. East, as the uncertain, sheepish Paxton, is terrific, believably portraying her evolution over the course of the film. Thatcher is similarly good as the more assertive, self-assured Barnes, and the two share a believable chemistry.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the narrative losing steam in the third act, Scott Beck and Bryan Woods\' \'Heretic\' is another fine film flying under the A24 banner. Combining terror with thought-provoking themes, it stands as a memorable addition to the pantheon of so-called ""elevated horror"". Visually and auditorily striking, and with a marvellously macabre Hugh Grant at its centre, \'Heretic\' is something of a revelation.', 'I saw seven films at this year\'s TIFF, and the one that got my vote for best picture was HERETIC starring Hugh Grant (who also would have gotten my vote for best actor if that was a voting category). I was very impressed seeing him get in touch with his dark side in the HBO miniseries THE UNDOING, but here he takes it to 11 playing an affable, religion-obsessed psychopath. It\'s a break from his rom-com persona of schizophrenic proportions.\n\nCo-stars Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East are also excellent playing two Mormon missionary girls who think that they will be calling on someone interested in converting to Mormonism. But Grant turns out to be far more erudite - and questioning -- about religion than they expected. When they realize that he\'s not really interested in converting but more in debating religion, they try to depart but discover that they\'re trapped inside. So begins a cat and mouse game where Grant puts their faith to the test.\n\nAs horror goes, it\'s solid, but doesn\'t reach the extremes of similarly claustrophobic horror films like FUNNY GAMES (original) and SPEAK NO EVIL (2022 version). The outcome is refreshingly unconventional. My only cavil is that the choice of Mormonism for the religion seems a tad calculated.\n\nIn short, see this movie if you\'ve ever enjoyed a Hugh Grant film and want to see him at the peak of his game. I haven\'t felt this sure about an acting Oscar nomination for a TIFF film since I saw Allison Janney in I TONYA in 2017\n\nSide note: There was a Q & A after the film and several people commended me on the way out for a question I asked: ""Was Richard Dawkins an influence?"" Co-director Bryan Woods confirmed that he was.', ""In Heretic, Hugh Grant steps into the brooding shoes of Mr. Reed, delivering a performance that's nothing short of captivating. Grant's portrayal, layered with a quiet intensity, draws us into the mystery of Reed's character, skillfully weaving charm and menace. The dialogue is elegantly crafted, with a razor-sharp wit that is self-aware and relatable enough that you can imagine a similar dialogue (and maybe just as scary) happening after thanksgiving dinner between a few salty relatives. It's the kind of banter that delights as much as it disturbs, showing that screenwriters knew how to dance with words and really capitalize on Grant's electric everyman charm.\n\nBut, for me, they fumbled the choreography of the plot itself.\n\nThe atmosphere in Heretic is ripe with tension, a steadily simmering suspense that feels almost Hitchcockian (I'm being generous, but it's good). Yet, unlike Hitchcock's masterpieces, where each action feels inevitable, Reed's journey teeters precariously on the edge of believability, but never really lands there for me. While we're willing to suspend disbelief for a while, waiting to hear Reed's motivator, the film's premise ultimately strains under the weight of its own ambitions. Mr. Reed's improbable decisions-and the film's insistence that these are plausible-leave one questioning not only his motives but perhaps even the script's own coherence. It's as though the filmmakers were intent on building a labyrinth but forgot to place a satisfying prize at its center. Sure, the payoff leads to Reed's main point, philosophically, but his actions in the end seem so bizarre and unjustified by the plot that I was scratching my head trying to figure out why he didn't just start a skeptics YouTube channel and be done with it.\n\nIn the end, we're left with a hollow aftertaste, a sense of having been led to a precipice only to find the bridge unbuilt. While Grant's performance deserves commendation, even his talent can't fully bridge the gap between the film's fascinating setup and its underwhelming resolution.\n\nAnd, without spoilers, the mild final nod to the OTHER possibility was a weak plot move that feels like throwing a bone to the losing philosophical side on the off chance you offended someone.\n\nIn sum, Heretic is a beautiful journey through the maze with Grant manhandling the role from start to finish, even if it leaves you feeling somewhat lost upon reaching its incomplete end.\n\nIf only the filmmakers had paid as much attention to plot structure as they did to Reed's impeccable, if confounding, choices, Heretic might have stood among this year's most memorable thrillers.\n\nWhatever I think of THIS movie, I can't wait to see more Hugh Grant in the horror genre. That was a true joy. Also, honorable mention to the two leading ladies who played well off of each other. This movie was never held back by the cast, that's for sure."", 'I was both surprised and disappointed by this. The first half was set up beautifully. A highly engrossing, suspenseful and edgy psychological mystery with a seemingly benevolent hermit inviting two green Mormon missionaries into his foreboding home for a religious chat. The topic is refreshingly intellectual for the genre and is actually thrilling until you see what it is building to - standard horror cliche. High Grant gives by far his best ever performance, riffing on the easy going charm of his romantic screen persona until something far more sinister is revealed. The two Mormon characters though are very poorly written and behave both stupidly and inconsistently to how they have been established which makes the whole thing a lot less engaging. What initially is exciting becomes very unsatisfying as contrivances pile up. Still an interesting watch but only for the first hour.', '1. Hugh Grant is a tour de force-God, I love that man! What a career he\'s had, and he\'s absolutely at the top of his game here.\n\n2. The two female leads also deliver superb performances.\n\n3. ""Heretic"" comes across as a watered-down version of the French horror classic Martyrs, one of my all-time favourite horror films.\n\n4. As a cynical 💩 that I am I found myself surprisingly aligned with many of the film\'s controversial points (couldn\'t help but feel seen by Hugh Grant\'s character-didn\'t see that coming, haha).\n\n5. I probably wouldn\'t recommend it if you\'re very religious...unless you\'re open to it?\n\n6. The movie has some uneven pacing and falls flat in parts - cutting 20-30 minutes could have made a huge difference, as all the tension it builds up just starts to fade halfway through.\n\n7. And the ending? So anticlimactic, I can\'t even!\n\n8. Still a very worthwhile watch if you\'re a horror fan.', 'There will no doubt be some people who saw the trailer for Heretic and thought, ""People being held against their will? I\'ve seen that a hundred times now,"" but that\'s just the thin wrapping paper that covers this intricate puzzle box.\n\nEnormous credit goes to the writers who played such a big part in making this film so refreshing. Rare is it that characters, who would be easy to be two dimensional, in a premise like this feel so human. From the way the discussions the missionaries have together, to the intricate details the viewer may have thought were ignored, it\'s all covered so well. Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East are excellent in their roles, being friends who outside of their faith, may not have forged a relationship at all, with their respective cynicism and naivety both being fleshed out. Unsurprisingly, Hugh Grant steals the show with his brilliant performance as a rational thinker who goes to irrational lengths. He\'s so disarming and so... Hugh Grant, that there are numerous times one can\'t help but smile, even as things take a turn for the worse, demonstrating how everyday monsters use their charm to do terrible things.\n\nIt also makes a nice change to feel genuinely tense and worried for the characters, instead of because you\'re expecting a jump scare. The atmosphere is superbly woven and its clever intricacies leave the viewer constantly wondering what\'s to come.', ""I'm not sure what I was expecting from Heretic, but it certainly wasn't deep theological discourse and intense religious diatribe courtesy of Hugh Grant. Not that I have a problem with that: when Grant's character, Mr. Reed, is challenging the doctrines of organised religion, the film is actually very engaging and frequently funny, the actor putting in a marvellously offbeat performance, Reed frequently making a lot of sense. Of course, this is a horror film, so even though a lot of what Grant's character says seems logical, the extremes he eventually goes to to prove his point are not at all reasonable.\n\nChloe East and Sophie Thatcher play Mormon missionaries who pay Mr. Reed a visit with the hope of converting him to their religion. Reed, however, has his own sinister agenda. What follows is an intense game of cat and mouse, the missionaries desperately trying to reason with their host while trying to find a way to escape from his home.\n\nThe film's strongest scenes are those in the first half of the film, in which Reed disquietingly questions the girls' beliefs while positing plausible alternatives - Grant is both affable and subtly menacing. Much of the first hour is simply conversation between Reed and the missionaries, and yet it is superbly unsettling, hinting at the man's craziness without going over the top. The latter half of the film is slightly less effective, visceral horror replacing the verbal dread, but it is still entertaining, and the film closes leaving the viewer with plenty of food for thought.\n\n7/10."", ""Heretic is a movie about two young mormon girls who are on a mission to baptize people. One stormy night, their journey takes them to the house of a strange man who invites them in and begins to ask them questions that makes them question their faith. These questions start off as relatively harmless, but slowly become more sinister and eventually end up in a macabre game where the girls are forced to choose between belief and disbelief, and the answers they choose may cost them their lives - or worse.\n\nThe script for this movie is excellent. Most of the film is dialogue that builds into an edge of your seat battle of wits between the man and the two women. The theological questions about the origins of story and religion and faith is absolutely terrific. Especially since it is two relatively naive young women who believe versus an older man who has had a crisis of faith and gone in search of the deeper truth - and came back with answers that transformed him into something truly strange and terrifying.\n\nHugh Grant KILLS it in this film. Literally. He never gives the mustache twirling villain performance - he becomes a character I've never quite seen before in a movie. You can never quite put your finger on this guy - but he has gone in quest of answers and become so good at what he does that he has a power about him to control people - which is right out of the religious scriptures that he has been studying. He is like the Riddler from Batman - ever asking questions only he thinks he knows the answers to and the deeper you go into his lair the more danger you are in. Honestly, this is a Hannibal Lector or John Malkovich in Line of Fire level great performance of a villain. Oscar worthy.\n\nThe two young actresses in this film are also excellent. They play off Hugh in a way that shows their genuine feminine strength - intelligence, - creativity - and captures the innocent human drive to believe that despite all of the evidence to the contrary - something good must be out there and if we believe in it miracles can happen and good can overcome evil.\n\nHeretic is definitely a superb psychological horror with terrific script, great performances, and hands down one of the best films of 2024."", 'A24 once again strikes another good thriller/horror flick with a great sense of atmosphere, interesting concept, and strong performances from the entire cast. Filled with a good balance between some dark comedy and tension, the writing provides interesting themes and character dynamics that helps to establish the atmosphere surrounding them. Including some impressive camerawork and production designs despite being a more simple setting.\n\nThe performances are great, particularly Hugh Grant as he is wicked, hilarious, and creepy at the same time. Alongside some good dialogue, musical score, and direction throughout. The characters I found to be interesting, although I do wish some of the characters could have been a bit more explored at times. Including some certain choices with the narrative (especially the third act) that I thought could have been a bit better. But as a whole, A24 knocked it out of the park again.', ""The more you know, the less you know\n\nThe trailer for this was amazing, actual film in many ways is better than the trailer\n\nAll three main protagonist were incredibly well acted, the mis en scene made you feel suitably claustrophobic & it would make a great stage play\n\nReligion & faith are the centre of the story and the filmmakers have crafted an incredible journey where you the audience feel you know more than the missionaries at times but there are many dead end in this mouse trap & you'll never fully understand what you're seeing.

A 8/10."", ""As a big fan of Hugh Grant, I was excited for Heretic, and at first, it lived up to the anticipation. The movie starts slow but intriguingly, with almost the entire first half relying on dialogue to keep you hooked. Grant's philosophical monologue about religion midway through is the highlight-while it doesn't offer new insights, his delivery makes it thought-provoking and refreshing.\n\nUnfortunately, after building suspense for most of the runtime, the story falters. The promising setup leads to a weak payoff, relying on cheap storytelling tricks that undercut its potential. The ending feels rushed and unsatisfying, leaving the impression that the writers ran out of steam.\n\nHeretic could have been a masterpiece if it had followed through on its initial promise. It's worth a watch for Grant's performance and the interesting ideas it explores, but ultimately, it falls short."", 'I was lucky to catch the infamous blueberry pie advanced screening of Heretic (2024) in theaters this evening. The story follows two young Mormon missionaries who meet with a man interested in learning more about their faith after a previous encounter. As their conversation unfolds, the young women realize that the discussion is taking a dark turn, and they may be in serious danger.\n\nHeretic is co-written and co-directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, the team behind the horror gem 💎 Haunt. The cast includes Hugh Grant (Notting Hill), Sophie Thatcher (Yellowjackets), Chloe East (The Wolf of Snow Hollow), and Topher Grace (That \'70s Show).\n\nThis film is intricately crafted, with elite writing and performances. Sophie Thatcher shines as an underrated, emerging scream queen, and her chemistry with Chloe East is spot-on. Hugh Grant delivers a chilling performance as a serial killer, meeting my high expectations. The dialogue is cleverly written, with lighthearted moments, including a surprising pornographic opener, as well as witty religious and Monopoly analogies that were fun. These smart touches add depth to the script and overall premise.\n\nThe horror elements are superb, using long, still shots that heighten tension and rely on reaction shots. Yet, the film doesn\'t shy away from gore, featuring intense slashes and kills that demand attention. The scenes with the religious ""prophet"" were visually impressive. The film\'s twist ending brings everything full circle, leaving a strong impact.\n\nIn conclusion, while Heretic isn\'t perfect, it offers plenty for horror enthusiasts to enjoy. I\'d rate it 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.', ""In Heretic, Hugh Grant (Mr. Reed) gives one of the best performances of the year. He is very unnerving in this role and that alone is worth the price of admission to see. I hope this isn't a one and done for him because we need him in more horror movies, he is a natural. Sophie Thatcher (Sister Barnes) and Chloe East (Sister Paxton) give top notch performances as well. This is a very religious horror movie. It is a dialogue heavy film, which I personally enjoyed but some people might not. It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares because just Hugh talking in this film can send chills down your spine. Could've been better towards the end but this is still a solid entry into the genre."", 'I was disappointed with this film, but glad I went to see Hugh Grant. All 3 leads were suberb. Interesting idea, but the story made no sense and did not work for me as either a psychological or supernatural horror. I felt the underlying theme has been done too many times - ""psychopath man imprisons two young women and tortures them psychologically and physically"". It would have worked better if it had been two young men. I doubt Richard Dawkins will be encouraging Humanists to adopt this film to sell atheism. If anything, it made me respect religious beliefs more.\n\nI was disappointed with this film, but glad I went to see Hugh Grant. All 3 leads were suberb.', 'Heretic by all means was fantastically made, and was one of the better horror/thriller movies that are being released these days. Although the movie had a strong start and middle act, towards the end of the movie and especially the ending itself was not at all what i would have hoped for a film of this nature. Given its introspective and theological tones and well written writing that gave the opportunity to question your own personal beliefs, I left the theatre disappointed because my questions had been answered and I had no need to question anything. Maybe that was the point who knows. 6/10.', ""Challenging one's beliefs is essential to either grow them... or to break them. A fantastic film that explores the depths of faith and religion. How far would you go for your religion? This movie, carried by a heavy heartfelt performance by Hugh Grant, delivers an incredible thriller based of an original idea. This film challenges the ideas of many different religions and the faith people have in them... yet it adds a horrifying twist. This movie is not only a good thriller, but the intellectual dialogue creates the masterpiece it 100% is. As a believer in a religion, this was interesting to watch to captivate entertaining and relevant questions and topics that one could face. This will live as one of my personal favorite thrillers within this decade."", ""Acting was stunning. Hugh Grant plays a perfect psychopath who is creepy and occasionally funny. The film would stand strong in a suspense/psychological thriller category without the, in my opinion, unnecessary supposed supernatural scene that I guess puts it in the horror category. The premise of the film is great and leaves you with lots of interesting musings regarding religion and how people believe things just because they are told. Overall it's a thought provoking, fun jump scare film. Don't have high expectation if you're a horror fan. It's more of a suspense film that gets the heart rate up!"", 'Two Mormon missionaries, Paxton and Barnes, are lured into the home of polite and knowledgeable Mr. Reed. He is eager to discuss their convictions and hear the good news. Too eager. When the theology discussion takes a dark turn, the sisters are equally enthusiastic about leaving. If they can.\n\nHeretic is an intense, chilling, and frighteningly sincere discussion about the horror of ideas. It is thrilling to see where each topic and turn leads the characters. I enjoyed the deep dialogues about myth, choices, and awkward topics like polygamy and Mormon underwear.\n\nHugh Grant (Mr. Reed) was present at this world premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival. Grant appeared to relish the atypical role for him of playing a ""baddie."" He was well cast along with Chloe East and Sophie Thatcher, both also present for the premiere, for they all seemed to be acting instinctually and from the heart. East and Thatcher were once Mormon themselves, and Grant bonded with certain aspects of Mr. Reed. ""I found,"" said Grant about his character\'s views on religion ""that we had a lot in common."" No wonder they were so good. They were channeling part of their life experiences. Great casting.', 'What else can really be said? The initial premise is interesting and it certainly leaves you wondering what could possibly happen next- especially with a man who just meanders and talks and doesn\'t directly ""threaten"". A Very solid first half.\n\nBut after the over halfway-ish point of the movie, it felt like it was trying to be smarter than it was with the most generic of truths, and sudden Sherlock Holmes levels of noticing (she noticed, but didn\'t tell her friend????).\n\nThe ending ultimately sours the entire film. Honestly, anything would have been better than the ending we got.\n\n6/10, More than Decent.', 'Gen X reporting in. It was a Great day at the AMC, and a great year for horror films in general. This is my 2nd favorite horror this year next to The Substance. Loved the dialogue, cinematography, music and over all vibe of this one. Its Original and keeps you guessing! A few jump scares and a small amount of gore, this one is a different kind of horror film. 239 characters to go, gee wiz. What else to say without spoiling. The acting was top notch, loved the casting of the nuns! 116 characters to go, 94 characters, why are you still reading, go see this film! Are you there yet? There is no end credits scene.', ""I am going to echo what some others have said. The first half of this movie is brilliant. It lost me about halfway through, though. I wish so much that the writers would have chosen a different path. Heretic could have been one of the most genius movies ever written if their villain would have been a different sort and had different motivations. While hard to choose a number for this movie, I think I'm feeling 6 1/2. Great acting. Great cinematography. And, like I said, brilliant script in the first half. A thought-provoking film until it isn't. Also, the ending is more ambiguous than I would like it to be. If the whole movie were like the first half, this would be a solid 9. But alas."", ""Heretic was incredible. Works on so many levels. As a simple horror film with great performances. Hugh Grant is really good. Anyone else would have gone full Vincent Price in the role, which would have worked, but he played it totally natural and that worked way more. He was so creepy for not playing it creepy.\n\nBut beyond that it examined religion from both sides, those who believe and those who don't, and really hit in my own ambiguous feelings towards it all. It's one of those rare films that manages to really make you think whilst being utterly entertaining from beginning to end. Up there with the Substance as film of the year. There is one line about prayer towards the end that really hit home for a devout atheist, lapsed Catholic like myself.\n\nI'm so going to watch this film again when it hits streaming. I loved this film so, so much."", 'You may wonder who Hugh Grant really is in this movie? Hugh Grant is a character who creates his world (symbolized by the wooden labyrinth). He behaves like God - he tells his ""prophets"" what they are to say to others. Yet the prophets, all women (thus a caricature of biblical prophets, who are generally men, even if talmudic Judaism sees them as women too) are imprisoned by him. That excludes him being a devil, who as we know, is very partial to women. Yet he clearly is not a good God too.\n\nCreativity, control, imprisonment, dislike of women - that are known features of that evil god, known as Demiurge, and introduced by Plato. Towards Demiurge points also the otherwise absurd ""simulation theory"" as who would simulate this world for us ...?\n\nIn some sense, the ""prophets"" are living in a Platonic cave, where the only light comes from Demiurge Reed (interestingly, only he is able to bring fire there, not the Mormon sisters with matchsticks, who, by the power of this comparison, do not live in light/truth), who sells some truth after all (he says that his ""prophets"" do not want to leave this place, exactly like the Platonic dwellers of the cave). It is regrettable that this piece of truth exposed by Reed- similarities in religions point to the kernel of truth at the beginning of all religious iterations - is not really discussed here.\n\nAlso the ending, which could be seen as rebirth can be perhaps better interpreted as leaving the Platonic cave.', 'There are certainly some worthwhile discussions in this movie re: religion vs. Atheism. But especially toward the end, the plot takes too many weird turns that stretch believability and get overly contrived.\n\nUltimately, I think the overall point of this movie is that although religion is mostly false and untrue, and there cannot be ""one correct religion"", religion can still make you a better person, depending on how you approach it. Mr. Reed approaches it with much anger and cynicism, whereas Paxton, though naive, approaches religion in a way that helps her to be a better, more empathetic person.\n\nI didn\'t really buy Sophie Thatcher in this role. She\'s not a bad actress and certainly attractive, but this character just didn\'t seem to fit her.', ""This is a movie I had my eye on for a while, especially after it premiered at Fantastic Fest over a month ago. Now that I've watched the movie, I can proudly say that Heretic (2024) is not only one of the best religious horror movies I've seen in a while, but it is also one of the best movies of 2024.\n\nPositives for Heretic (2024): As someone who isn't very religious, this is one of the smartewt written religious horror movies I've seen in a very long time. The movie does a fantastic job at tackling these religious themes through the conversations and dialogue without insulting religion. The movie makes the audience question their beliefs whether they're religious or not without having to bash it in their heads or treating them like morons. One of the big reasons for the movie's success is Hugh Grant as Mr. Reed and this is one of those performances that I'm going to be super pissed if he doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. I also have to say that Mr. Reed is one of the more charming villains in the horror genre and that's something I don't often say with a lot of horror movies. I also enjoyed Sophie Thatcher as Sister Barnes and Chloe Easter as Sister Paxton. Sophie Thatcher is definitely the more calm and level headed of the two women and she comes off as someone who you want to root for. Then, you have Chloe East as the more freightened person in this situation, but thankfully even she manages to step up her game and stop acting like a courage by the end of the movie. I am also happy to day that this is one of those horror movies that doesn't use jumpscares to get the horror elements across to the audience, instead the horror in this movie comes from the conversations in the first act and I was attempted on the edge of my seat through that first act. And finally, the movie ends in a way that makes you feel good about yourself and your beliefs regardless of whether you're apart of a religious group or not.\n\nOverall, Heretic (2024) is one of the most brilliant and wonderful viewing experience I've had all year all and I highly recommend this movie to everyone."", ""Well, that was a surprise. I was expecting a schlock horror, but this is something a tad more thought provoking - and worth going to see.\n\nThere are three main characters. The two female leads Sofia Thatcher and Cloe East, do a good job with their roles and are eminently watchable. However, Hugh Grant (for me) steals the show - he does creepy very well, although there's a small flavour of campness to his characterisation.\n\nThe script is above average. This isn't a spoiler, but the main theme is religious belief, and whilst the debate is first year Uni philosophy standard, it's still thought provoking and well written. I think this adds to the richness of the film. The Direction is simple and straightforward, with nothing too elaborate, but that helps with this type of film. Neither is the horror overplayed, it's reasonably (relatively) subtle.\n\nI didn't find the film that scary, but it was still tense and did have the odd jump scare. A good way to spend a couple of hours."", ""The obsession with religion and making it look like a psychological thriller is ingenious and productive. Hugh Grant has a clear message on what is the one true religion. The undeniable scary fact of it is Control. It is a testament and the architecture of what he truly believes in. His house is one scary environment. His intellect is really spot on with his theology. The two girls in the movie are amazing. Although I don't know why they talk about condoms and porn in the beginning of the movie. It is truly bizarre. However when they do meet Hugh Grant , the movie just makes it intriguing to watch.\n\nI'm just amazed that the movie has no profanity. I'm just mind blown and happy that I got to watch this in theaters. Heretic shows you when religion is about control, it is scary."", 'I suppose that many of us have had the god-squad on the doorstep trying to peddle their philosophising but I doubt many are quite as prepared, or as tempting, as the butter-wouldn\'t-melt ""Reed"" (Hugh Grant) when the enthusiastic sisters ""Barnes"" (Sophie Thatcher) and ""Paxton"" (Chloe East) arrive at his door. Promises of a meeting with his wife and some blueberry pie lure them in and soon they are having a meaningful debate that rather puts the girls on edge. That anxiety only gets worse as there\'s no sign of the wife and the scented candle proves to have a most unusual, and illuminating, aroma. They conclude that getting out of his home is the best plan, but that isn\'t going to be straightforward. He has other plans, and they are going to have to play a game of belief/disbelief if they are to have any hope of getting back to their church. The horror aspects of this are not especially interesting - it\'s a sort of competent hybrid of ""Escape Room"" meets ""Cluedo"". What helps this stand out a bit more is a subtly menacing effort from Grant and the standard of the writing. The conversation between the three for the first half of the film is quite thought provoking in itself. It asks questions that are truly valid and worthy of consideration amongst those of or without organised faith. The assertions around ""iterations"", burgers and games of ""Monopoly"" also raise a few solid questions about carts and horses that I rather appreciated as we are invited to question or evaluate the whole scope of monotheistic religions and their role in our lives. The two women gel well together here too, realising that they are in some sort of peril - both intellectual and physical, and that latter threat is well demonstrated by some creepy settings and creatively used audio. I didn\'t love the conclusion - I actually found it really quite disappointing, as if Scott Beck had just run out of ideas or didn\'t quite have the courage of his earlier convictions, but this is the most substantial part I\'ve seen Grant play in a while and he holds it together well. Not your typical psychological drama and worth a watch, I\'d say.', '""What is the one true religion?""\n\nWell, wouldn\'t we all like to know that! In Heretic, Hugh Grant plays Mr. Reed, a doddering middle-aged intellectual, greeting two young Mormon women, who have unfortunately rung his doorbell. Throughout this Gothic horror thriller, he will ask them to question their faith and make some arguments about the iterative nature of religions in general. The other part of the film is stock horror stuff, annoyingly distracting rather than complementing the pleasantly verbose arguments.\n\nReed will lead them into basement horror to show them the one true religion. I\'ll not reveal that reveal, but it is as good a religion as Joseph Smith could have offered.\n\nThe girls are not without defenses, albeit after a period when Mr. Reed has become a menacing theologian rather than cheeky Hugh-Grant, dry-wit charmer. Horror tropes like dank basements, leaky roofs, and clueless elder sent to find the girls are present but most of the engaging action is of the mind games.\n\nThe intellectual tension is a comfortable companion to the usual horror tropes, and writers/directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods keeps entertaining us with the mind games rather than usual scare-fest operations. That this thriller is the opposite of their taciturn A Quiet Place is to their creative credit.\n\nReed persuasively argues that the world\'s religions have gotten it all wrong, compounded by innumerable iterations and authority that blocks serious skepticism or simple inquiry. A college professor or teacher like him is rare, especially one who trumpets Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace while illustrating impressively from the Bible.\n\nHeretic is not a Dan-Brown adventure into the Catholic occult, rather it is a Poe-like short story of two naïve young women from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who apparently did not meet such an eager listener in their disappointing day punctuated by local kids who wanted to see their ""magic underwear."" I should clarify: Sister Paxton (Chloe East) is a naïve product of her church\'s full indoctrination while Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher) is surprisingly astute but still young enough to have clueless edges.\n\nBecause the girls believe Reed\'s wife is cooking pie in the kitchen, or rather that she even exists, the writers/directors establish a foothold on a major argument about the danger of blind faith. Whatever, for former Catholic boys like me, arguing the truth of belief and the risk of faith, Heretic is nectar. One of the best movies of the year.', 'If you\'ve seen the trailer or even a caption for the movie, then you have the entire plot right there in front of your eyes. That said, the movie is a gripping cat and mouse-like joy ride.\n\nHugh Grant is perfectly cast as the smirky snarky glib obsessive maniacal closet sociopath - played so well, you wonder why he hasn\'t played more villainous roles over his illustrious career.\n\nAfter a brief exposition in which to the two young female leads chit chat and very efficiently after only a few minutes define their characters very precisely, and without any tedious backstory, there they are knocking on Hugh Grant\'s door within minutes.\n\nTo the film\'s credit, the tension, awkwardness, and creepiness ensue almost immediately. And after curiously getting overly comfortable and chatty, the two young ladies proceed to slowly and methodically break every rule in their Mormon Neighborhood Outreach Safety Handbook.\n\nIgnoring a series of red flags and being way to patient waiting for Grant\'s wife to appear, they proceed room by room into Grant\'s devilish maze. To be fair, Grant\'s ""history of religion"" got somewhat preachy and his ""history of monopoly"" did get tedious, but the moviegoer was rewarded with relentless suspense thereafter.\n\nIt\'s perhaps incredible that Grant could keep his little ""warehouse"" a secret, seemingly for years, without detection, but I\'ll guess we\'ll have to overlook that. And you would think there would have been a more aggressive search for the missing girls when by daylight they would have missing for over 12 hours already. Just small points.\n\nAll this said, I was gripped to my seat, hands clenched, for nearly the entire movie.', 'This is the horror stunner of the year, not the overrated sloppola that was ""The Substance."" Unlike that one-idea mess, this movie has many ideas on its mind, articulated in a deliciously entertaining dialectic between Hugh Grant\'s nihilistic atheist and two young Mormon girls. The young actresses playing these girls were both refreshingly fresh faces to me - not some tired castings we\'ve seen before. And both were incredible actors, projecting the perfect blend of intelligence, fear, and thoughtfulness. It\'s a fun game of human chess (or monopoly) that, unlike the recent confined-to-a-house horror film Barbarian, stayed strong throughout its run time. I\'m so impressed with these writer/directors. This is way next level from ""a quiet place.""', 'I was enjoying this movie until they entered the basement part of the movie.\n\nI felt like it was a great analogy of when for me at least is when jehovah witnesses come to your front door and literally hold you prisoner on your doorstep no matter what you say to them and kind of flipping the tables on that.\n\nBut once it got past a certain point I didn\'t care and I knew the ""religion"" part was gonna be the winner per sa ,like I was meant I guess too dislike the Hugh grant character, but bro was just spitting facts and the final shot was just cheesy cringe.\n\nBest thing about the movie was Hugh grant.', 'Heretic\n\nA stunning discussion on religion and personal beliefs that turns sinister rather quickly, Heretic is aptly named. It is a very fast talking, fast point making, and quickly terrifying.\n\nLike an Agatha Christie novel, the film plants hints that may go unnoticed by a casual viewer. I was paying attention though, and it made the ride even more fun because I saw what was coming, or how the manipulations were happening.\n\nThe film thinks it is very smart, and for the most part, it is. One of the main characters makes a valid point in that part of the narrative had to be quickly adjusted due to an unexpected revelation.\n\nThis is a spoiler free review, so I am wrapping it up quickly with a ""go see it"" opinion. I really enjoyed the metaphors used, and the thought processes that were outlined. It gets the audience thinking, and puts the audience in suspense for the horrific aspects.', ""Not to be confused with Exorcist II: The Heretic. This one's actually a good movie.\n\nWell, to be fair, Hugh Grant made this a good movie. Of course, that's par for the course.\n\nEver question your faith? Or wanted to hear more about its origins? Well, come on in and let Hugh Grant's Mr. Reed turn the tables on two Mormon Missionaries who visit his isolated home during a huge storm. I don't know what's scarier: What Mr. Reed has to say or what the missionaries do.\n\nI kinda expected more and definitely didn't expect this to be as slow as it was. YES, it had it's very well shot scenes of tension as the movie's mostly about two young ladies trapped in a scary philosopher's house that holds many twists and turns. And yet, WOW, this was slow at times.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I liked it. Reminded me a lot of the same feelings when I watched The Human Centipede, Knock Knock, Split, Barbarian and Black Phone, regardless of the these all having somewhat similar settings/conflicts. I just felt something was off.\n\nHugh and the ultimate meaning of the movie saved it. I wasn't really keen on the two girls' acting, but they were serviceable. Hugh really engaged me and despite him being in the grand majority of it, I could've even wanted more from him.\n\nI did end up liking the reveal and how it all really paid off. And the opening background shots were absolutely stunning. It is a recommendation, for sure.\n\n***\n\nFinal Thoughts: I actually don't think I've seen a bad Hugh Grant performance. Here are my top ten of his:\n\n1. Maurice (1987) 2. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) 3. Notting Hill (1999) 4. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023) 5. Glass Onion (2022) 6. Love Actually (2003) 7. Heretic (2024) 8. The Gentlemen (2019) 9. Nine Months (1995) 10. Wonka (2023)"", 'I would like to preface this by saying I am actually a Mormon. Two years ago, I was a missionary knocking on people\'s doors, and although I never had anyone lock me in their house to play a faith-testing game, I did run into my fair share of people who lived to challenge my faith. I watched this film in a theater full of other Mormons (I live in Utah), and most of these people had served missions themselves. You may be pleased to know that there were plenty of laughs shared throughout the viewing of this film. Say what you will about Mormons, but I\'d say we are pretty good sports about our media portrayals (i.e., The Book of Mormon Broadway show).\n\nSo, on to the film. First things first-Hugh Grant was a really interesting choice to play this role. His rom-com charisma is still very much alive and has somehow carried over into this A24 horror flick. It feels really incongruous. Much of this film, in fact, reeks of incongruity. Dare I say most A24 films do. The film neither takes a firm stand on religion as an overall negative or positive; in fact, elements of the film (perhaps naively) sparked pride in my religious fervor. One moment I found myself rolling my eyes at overplayed religious critiques; the next, I felt the film was highlighting the positive outcomes of religious experience.\n\nA24 throws a load of ""food for thought"" at its audience in hopes that, for the next hour or so, we\'ll unpack and make something of it ourselves. This often leaves me feeling unsatisfied, as we rarely see any resolution in their productions. This is a shame because they toy with such interesting source material and have great creative concepts. However, their writers seem to hate the audience, always leaving us out to dry in a state of uncertainty and dissatisfaction, forever lacking clarity and conciseness.\n\nIt\'s entertaining but disturbing-more so than I thought it would be. It\'s somewhat thought-provoking, providing enough to chew on. It\'s incredibly well-produced (as most A24 films are) but lacks the delivery of what a typical audience expects from a feature film: satisfaction, clarity, and simplicity.', ""What's good Hugh Grant, always plays 'Hugh Grant'. He doesn't actually do much in the way of 'character acting'. But in Heretic , as Mr Read, he is surprisingly menacing, yet still affable !\n\nUnlike many recent films, it is all logical, no glaring plot holes .e.g. Mobile phones won't work in Hugh's house, is explained and plausible. Just as you think, it's gone dark, surely they would use the torches on their phones? The characters switch them on.\n\nWith no plot hole distractions, you are kept rivetted and have no real idea what will happen next, as this tense thriller unfolds.\n\nMy only criticism is I though the ending slightly unsatisfying, but that's a minor personal gripe.\n\nHeretic is a thought provoking thriller, well worth a watch and a worthy 7.5/10."", 'This smart chamber piece from the dynamic duo Bryan Woods and Scott Beck keeps you thinking while delivering pure entertainment. The story unfolds in a way that\'s both intellectually sharp and visually compelling-a rare mix that constantly kept me intrigued.\n\nHugh Grant absolutely owns the screen, grounding the film as Mr. Reed, a character obsessed with deconstructing the strategy behind religion. Watching his twisted quest is a ride: it\'s unsettling yet irresistibly fun to watch.\n\nAt its core, this is a monster movie, but the ""monster"" here is something unique-Hugh Grant\'s Reed himself. Sure, a bit more scale might have been cool, but that\'d be a different movie altogether. For what it is, they nailed it, and I left fully satisfied.', ""Heretic is certainly an intriguing film, although it does get a little too clever for its own good towards the end and the whole thing starts to unravel a little bit. This doesn't negate the good work done earlier in the film so it still makes for an enjoyable watch.\n\nHugh Grant plays against type excellently as the sinister presence in the film. Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East are great as well as the two Mormon missionaries attempting to convert Grant. The three of them nail the tone and vibe of the piece perfectly. The two women play the uncertainty and fear well, while Grant manages to make his smarmy charm and subtle comedy work in the context of this role.\n\nAs mentioned I do think the story gets away from itself a little bit. It sets up lots of intriguing questions and sends the audience down a seemingly tantalising path, but once you emerge you will maybe feel a tad underwhelmed. The set up is also a bit too overdrawn and could have been a bit tighter. The film has a great atmosphere to it though, and it will have you on edge and certainly looks and feels creepy.\n\nSo although it maybe could have been a bit tighter in the story department towards the end, this is still a very enjoyable and interesting film that boasts some really solid performances, making it well worth a watch."", ""Heretic puts religion through the ringer in a thoroughly gripping slow burn that's got plenty of tricks up its sleeve. It presents its central argument with some unexpectedly funny metaphors and then pokes holes in its theories, pivots to a brief improvisation and finally reveals what this game has all been about in a satisfying fashion. It's a one location horror that doesn't delve as deep into the shifting areas as you'd expect but finds plenty of ways to make up for that.\n\nSophie Thatcher and Chloe East are a really good pairing because they contrast each other so well. Sophie Thatcher is more world weary whereas Chloe East is more naive as it seems like she misses obvious traps. That contrast is shown in everything from their costumes to the media they reference and how they reference it. Plus the film cleverly plays with your expectations based on what it tells you about them and the actresses previous roles.\n\nThe main attraction is undoubtedly Hugh Grant continuing his winning villain streak with a delightfully evil performance as he revels in what he's doing and is effortlessly threatening whilst delivering cheesy jokes. He contorts his natural British charms into something more off putting so even when he's being warm there's still something uncomfortable about it and it's made more effective because he always retains some composure, even when things don't go to plan.\n\nAs writers and directors, Scott Beck and Bryan Woods sustain the longest scenes through the meaty dialogue and Chung Chung-hoon's excellent slow moving cinematography and the horror succeeds by keeping jump scares to an absolute minimum. The lengthy debates about religion and its many forms are so enthralling the length almost goes unnoticed and the cinematography employing a lot of close ups and gradually moving between whoevers speaking adds a sense of dynamism."", ""What a shame. Hugh Grant gets the role of his lifetime, and doesn't have to be a fluffy pastry for his fans, and the screenwriter, who otherwise did a magnificent job for the first hour or so, flubs it as bad as the Yankees flubbed game five of the World Series.. This film had a lock for Best Actor nomination (and it still might), and, in addition, the direction of the film was outstanding (until the last fifteen minutes). This is where we get back to the writer, who is obviously very intelligent, and knows how to reveal a good story. There is so much to like about this film, which reminded me of The Collector, and Misery with James Caan. It had an opportunity to be one of the scariest films of all time.\n\nBut the writer flubbed it at the end; and went for the acceptable Hollywood ending. What a shame. I believe an ending with the two girls staring in the cellar at a collection of various religious door-bell ringers would have been far superior. I did like the red herring entry of one of the girls possibly being a robot, however. Regardless, the SUGGESTION of violence is FAR more effective than the filming actual violent scenes. This was proven time and time again by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, who only used violence as a last resort (with the exception of Psycho). Cheers to Hugh Grant for a magnificent job, however. I hope you get the nomination."", 'Wow, where do I begin with a movie like this.\n\nFirst I would have to say that this was a tale of two halves. The first half was very well done. It sets up a very nice unsettling creepy atmosphere that slowly builds tension.\n\nBut then comes the second half of the movie. ""The message"" was loud and clear for us that know ""the message"" when we see it. This movie was about 3 big religions. Christianity, Islam, and judaism (even though Judaism is only 0.2%). They claim that the biggest one of them all is Christianity. But of course that\'s not right because Islam is by far the biggest religion. But do you think they\'re going to poke fun at Islam? Do you think they\'re gonna poke fun at Judaism? Lol ....\n\nOf course rotten tomatoes loved it lol, it is currently sitting at 93% LOL!\n\nSo all in all this was a very disappointing movie. I would guess it was made on a budget of less than 3 million. I give it a 3 out of 10, and that\'s being generous. I\'m just glad I didn\'t pay a dime to see it, I\'ve learned my lesson with Hollywood movies.', ""Every moment is gripping, scares are authentic, and plot extremely well crafted. So many clever and thought-provoking ideas as well as 3 performances that will be impossible to forget.\n\nA big worry I have going into films this experimental and this philosophical is that they won't quite stick the landing. In other words, the idea won't quite mesh with the actual plot seen on screen. I've seen several movies like this fail to actualize their intentions. This is an exception to this pitfall. Each scene is more fascinating than the last, along with a few genuinely terrifying moments. A few sequences will have you squirming in your seat! I truly mean squirm, one scene in particular that I will not spoil.\n\nGo see this movie, go support it. This is the horror we all beg for and sticks with us forever."", ""I'm not great with words but this movie had me leaving the theatre absolutely questioning existence itself!\n\nA thought provoking horror movie wasn't on my 2024 bingo card but I'm glad it turned up.\n\nHugh Grant owns every scene he's in, menacing to a point yet alarmingly disabling the entire ethos behind religion itself.\n\nSophie Thatcher and Chloe East play the perfect targets as Mormon missionaries, naive to a point yet knowledgeable enough to keep the antagonist on his toes.\n\nI don't know what else I can write but review needs to be a certain length. Potato\n\nDefinitely watch again. And again."", ""I'm not one shy from throwing around superlatives, but I genuinely believe Heretic is the strongest horror movie of the year.\n\nI can only imagine how difficult is was for the three main cast members to memorize (and deliver) their lines. The dialogue scenes felt natural, and all three actors bounced off each other so well.\n\nReligious horror movies have always been a favorite of mine. But even without a church as the main setting, this movie manages to build tension of the highest level. If horror wasn't so incredibly underrated at the Oscars, Hugh Grant would be up for an award right now, but sadly, he'll have to do with my 10-star rating.\n\nA24 may have just made their best movie to date!"", ""Its after a very long time I felt like I watched a movie that was genuinely satisfying. Its not very often you walk out of the cinema with a huge grin on your face at having witnessed something truly special. If you are someone who enjoys horror with brains, this is the movie for you. It's a thinking man's horror film . It doesn't matter if you're religious or Athiest, the film mostly walks a middle line on this topic but it's just fascinating to watch Hugh Grant in this avatar and the man steals the show and how! His performance will be talked about for years to come. Even though the movie is centered on these 3 characters trust me you will be glued to your seat to the very end. I also liked the almost inception like ending. For me this was the best film I've seen this year."", ""This movie avoids the classic Hollywood trope of religious people being naive and idiotic. At the start of the movie it's easy to see that it is portraying one of the sisters as the older, experienced missionary and the other as the young naive and blind faith missionary. As the movie go on and the protagonist requires that these sisters question their world view. Both the sisters get a chance to show that they are not just blindly following a cult, but they actually have real questions themselves that they are still trying to find answers for, but they have faith that they will.\n\nFor a horror movie, I think it shows a lot of respect for people of faith by showing them as competent, caring and deep people. It also brings up legit questions about religion without making it feel like it's trying to checkmate religion.\n\nThe movie was very intense and unexpected. There were definitely some flaws, like there are a lot of reasons why people are on birth control other than because they are sexually active. But a fun time all in all."", ""I went to see this film in the cinema last night and was shocked to see so many positive reviews on here? A couple of people actually left the cinema mid film, to give you an idea of how bad it was! I would rate it about a 4, but that is purely because the acting was good, the script was not! A shame really because the storyline had really great potential. I felt like i was waiting and waiting for something to actually happen, and i kept checking the time to see how long the film had left in the hopes that it was still going to go somewhere! On a positive note, Hugh Grant plays a great weird guy and i'd be eager to see him play a similar part in another film!""]",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/herege/8dd99992-bee5-4371-bc63-2cbf7b1bf7d4.webp

The plot feels like a lazy retread of the first but I didn't care about any of the characters. Paul Mescal was so wooden it sounded like he was reading his lines. If this is how he acts, I really don't see what all the fuss is about with him. Am I missing something.\n\nThe action, while visually impressive, lacked impact. Some studio exec probably thought 'hmm there was only 1 exotic animal in the first film, we can do better! Let's add way more!'"", 'The film offers a thrilling experience, the narrative and character development could have been more robust. At times, the storyline feels rushed, and some character arcs lack the depth that made the original ""Gladiator"" so compelling. This leads to an overall experience that, in my opinion, does not quite reach the heights of the original.\n\nAdditionally, Denzel Washington\'s portrayal is noteworthy, but his American accent felt somewhat out of place within the context of the film. It occasionally detracted from the immersion, making it harder to connect with his character fully.\n\nTo sum it up, ""Gladiator II"" is an entertaining blockbuster that delivers on visual spectacle and excitement. While it struggles with certain aspects of storytelling and character depth, it still manages to provide an enjoyable cinematic experience for fans of the genre.', ""Now as i watched the movie i truly tried to not hold it and compared it to the first one, but the movie borrows sooo much and put so many winks and easter eggs and cameo's its plain impossible not to compare.\n\nAnd yeah,alas, the first did absolutely everything, every single aspect better to much better and most definitely story/drama character wise.\n\nEven though tis definitely not the worst movie ever,this movie kind of symbolize the state of current Hollywood and how much it has declined over the last 2 decades. The fact so many people praising it confirms a bitter reality. Story and plot just don't matter or at least much less then it used to be, people are pleased when they see pretty pictures.\n\nThis movie definitely looks glorious and expensive and had a big grandeur, but it fails to me to have coherent driven plot, in the first movie every scene absolutely mattered, even during battles, characters spoke by their actions and where very consistent in how the character was portrayed.\n\nThis script ( from the same writer as that abominal napoleon movie) things feel random and forced.\n\nBattles feel so meh, nothing feels deserved or earned..\n\npity, acting was well though all where good to great acting performances wich makes it even more of a pity the story was so weak."", ""My main issue with this film is the total lack of gravitas from Paul Mescal. Russel Crow commanded respect, on screen his presence was immense and it was easy to believe he was a leader of men. Paul Mescal just doesn't have it. He tried to hard in his talisman speeches, but they had to be carried by the music instead of his command of the screen. Even his physical presence is underwhelming, he looked like a boy pretending to be a man. The emperors also lacked a sense of real danger and tyranny. Every time there was a flash back to the original I was reminded of how poor this film was in comparison. If you were hoping for a performance anywhere close to Russel Crowe or a Mel Gibson in Braveheart you will be sorely disappointed. Without the charisma and emotional gravitas of the leading man everything else fails to deliver. Paul Mascals character was very empty, he seemed like the generic man, nothing at all to distinguish him. This movie is a textbook example of how casting will make or break a movie."", ""I just watched the movie in a theater. It is full of entertainment battles ( although a little too much spectacularly blood ), the story line it's in the same path as the first ( you are not amazed cause you practically know what is going to happen ) with some changes here and there. Not the depth of the first one, you don't get the emotion of the firts one. The music it's not on the same level, Zimmer is a master and Gregson-Williams didn't catch that cloud. Mescal did his best (he's not Russell Crowe), and Denzel did what Denzel does, giving his character a whole other dimension. It's not bad, but you're not going feel the same way you felt after you watched The Gladiator back in 2000."", 'I was lucky to sit through an early screening here in NYC, so let\'s start with the obvious.\n\nGladiator 2 has superb CGI & practical effects. You will, at times, feel as though you are in Rome. Denzel excels in his role and is a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination, and the blood & gore is highly entertaining. What\'s not to like about a Roman gladiator lopping off a head in THEE Colosseum?\n\nNow, the drawbacks.\n\nPaul Mezcal, a phenomenal actor, fell short of what I wanted from him in the film. Without divulging the plot, he excels in one-on-one scenes and compliments his screen partners well. However, he could have done better in group settings where he was supposed to be the catalyst of the scene. As a ""leader"" throughout the film, inciting the rumblings of a rebellion, uprising, etc., we expect a draw from him. However, at no point was there a desire to follow him. This may be a nitpick but when the one character im supposed to be enraptured with doesn\'t make me want to charge into the fray it falls short of its target.\n\nThe story is better than average but could be better. It complements the bones of the original film and provides some fan service, but it is in no way a standalone marvel compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe music score was solid, but they could have taken some notes from Dune Part 2 on how to give an audience goosebumps during its most pivotal scenes.\n\nAll in all, it\'s a good counterpart to the original Gladiator, one of the better films of 2024, and will receive some Oscar buzz, but it falls short of what it could have been, which is a masterpiece.', ""Visuals are stunning, sets and costumes look reach and amazing. Pedro Pascal is great in every scene, he's really selling all the emotions with such subtlety and minimalim. And that's about it what I've found good here.\n\nMain actor is one of the huge problems, he always looks pale, like he is not really acting and has no real emotions. He was supposed to grab our hearts from scene one, however it somehow didn't happen. Film lacks some more time at the begining for the audiance to meet and fall in love with him, so that his motivations are more believeble and his story be more emotionally relatable.\n\nAnother huge issue is the story that goes everywhere, plot of Denzel Washington's character is just bizzare and bloated, diallogues are shallow in general...\n\nI expected worse, but anyhow this movie left me feel numb..."", ""This film was never going to be a Godfather Part II equivalent, no matter how much us fans of the original Gladiator might have hoped or dreamed that it could be.\n\nThe potential parallels are there, as too, are leanings towards this being a virtual next-gen rehash, so if you go into the movie theater expecting something fresh or new, well then, I regret to say, that you will likely be left wanting. Hoity-toity cinephiles will love to hate it for this reason alone, so if that's what you've paid your admission fee for, you'll get your money's worth.\n\nAlternatively, if you go with just the reasonable expectation of having fun and being entertained by the spectacle of a high production value Hollywood blockbuster, you also should be satisfied, and, just maybe even pleasantly surprised like I was."", ""The film has plenty to commend it. Spectacular set pieces. Multiple plots that weave together. Interesting side characters. A pace that rises and relaxes with the right beats. The feeling of a taking place within a rich Roman world that has a life of its own.\n\nBut it's hard to appreciate those when the film has numerous key flaws. There's very little tension outside of a 4th act twist, with everything before being a reskin of the events of the first film. The echoes aren't subtle either, but the characters quote their predecessors and we have multiple flashbacks. The action, the historical details, and even individual characters key decisions make so little that it often breaks the suspense of disbelief (not least of all that scene of kids playing football). Most critically, the key cast and Paul Mezcal most of all (but with the notable exception of Denzel Washington) simply fail to make their characters believable: that the scripts has them always giving stern speeches rather than simply talking doesn't help.\n\nThere's elements of a good film in there. But it's hard to appreciate them when the flaws stick out so sorely."", 'I went to the Copenhagen premiere yesterday, and the movie was great.\n\nThere is nothing in this movie, that I can\'t forgive, and all of the actors, deliver a solid performance. Especially though is Denzel Washington and his choices.\n\nThere are of course a few logical things regarding for example the naval battle.\n\nSharks and crystal clear water, makes no sense and is not at all logical, but it is also used so little, that\'s it is not too big of deal.\n\nI found the story enticing and exciting (maybe getting a bit to superficial in the end), but I don\'t think this movie would be so great, if it had only come out 3 years after the first one.\n\nThe same way ""Top gun: Maverick"" became a success, I also think this is a success, because the first one had time to be watched and adored for 24 years, setting a stage of anticipation for this sequel, and in my opinion, they deliver.', ""Everyone has seen Denzel Washington praising fellow actors Pedro Pascal and Paul Mescal for their acting - but the reality is there is nothing special - they are actors that acted - their performance did not elevate the film to the glory of the original.\n\nStoryline wise the film is a joke - the plot twists are illogical and only work because the characters are forced to change - the first half of the film concentrates on a man's desire for vengence which is overturned by a single line of dialogue.\n\nHollywood is failing - it clearly looks to have been influenced by accountants and MBA muppets that somehow believe the more twists a film contains the more $$ it attracts.\n\nSide note: if Rome was so great - why was it always falling apart."", 'While Gladiator II tries to capture the spectacle of the original, it ends up trading away its emotional depth and character-driven narrative for a loud, fragmented, and sometimes bizarre spectacle. The storyline feels jumbled and over-the-top, making it difficult to take seriously or fully invest in, even though some of its chaotic ideas-like CGI sharks and warships-are undeniably creative. But what\'s meant to be thrilling too often feels absurd, and those same sharks might be the best place to toss this film and let it sink from memory.\n\nThis sequel goes bigger with its visuals, but in doing so, it loses the grounded intensity that made Gladiator so compelling. Ridley Scott\'s digitally revamped Colosseum, filled with CGI rhinos, apes, and sharks, becomes an overwhelming display of pixels battling each other, while the human stakes that once drew us in are sidelined. The finale is especially disappointing, lacking the emotional punch that the original delivered so powerfully.\n\nGladiator II may be a feast for the eyes, but it\'s sadly hollow at its core. It\'s bigger and louder, yes-but not better.""', ""The movie has some strongpoints: Denzel's and Quinn's performances, the way the City looks and some of the battles in the Colosseum. Like all Ridley Scott's movies after KoH, the last good one, it adresses an audience who is only there for the nachos and the thrills and knows nothing about history, warfare or common sense.\n\nTo be fair, Ridley really can direct huge movies that look good. But the writing, the ending...Scarpa really should find a hobby.\n\nBeing such a fan of Gladiator I wanted so much for this one to be decent that I concentrated on the strong points and until the last 30 minutes hit this was a decent effort. The ending is nevertheless an utter mess, it's senseless and unpleasant, an overthetop insult to common sense.\n\nThe producer's money would have been better spent elsewhere. Mine too.\n\nThe incredibly bad: the monkeys, Caracalla's character, Macrinus 's fate after a good buildup, the sharks, attacking a city's walls by sea with siege towers, the way the roman legion looks, the Praetorians, the last speech, the uninspired use of the score... A word about Paul Mescal: he doesn't shine but really, how could he, with such writing. I think his performance was strong, I felt the emotions, he does good in the arena....really not his fault.\n\nRidley, you have fooled me for the last time.\n\nThe sad thing is: the ending in this one makes Napoleon seem ok 😔"", 'There are many (too many) errors in this movie to name, and that\'s without going into the lack of historical accuracy, bad CGI sharks or recycled formula and storyline (at times this feels more of a remake of Gladiator (2000) than a sequel to it).\n\nFor me, the biggest sin of them all is a simple sentence: ""the memory of what we do in life echoes in history"" (or a similar influencer instapost line), which was engraved in ENGLISH on the Colosseum walls. We\'re talking about a movie set in the 3rd century AD with an inscription in a language 2-3 centuries too young to even exist. Couldn\'t they do it in Latin, then add subtitles for people to read it? This fails largely beyond historical inaccuracy to bad production design, and made me cringe, revealing the movie for what it actually is: a sword and sandals for the Tik Tok generation. Lush and entertaining, spectacular at times, but a pointless effort. Was it worth bringing this story back, for ""this"", after 24 years? Or yet another desperate attempt of Hollywood to resurrect a story and hope it becomes a franchise?', ""The biggest problem with this movie is that it's essentially a soft reboot. If you've seen the first one, you'll quickly realize that you're watching something you've already seen. And once something becomes a repetition of something great, it's almost impossible to recapture that same level of greatness. Mescal, Washington, and the rest of the cast do their best, but this movie relies heavily on nostalgia. For the most part, it repeats the structure of the original story and follows all the clichés typical of sword-and-sandal films: the plot, the betrayal, the arena fights-you name it. The irony is that people who haven't seen the first one will probably enjoy this movie far more than those who remember the original."", ""Since Gladiator is my favorite movie of all time, I believe that it's almost unfair to try to hold it sequel to the same immaculate standard that Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe set for us 20 years ago. The biggest issue with Gladiator 2 is falling in love with the characters (or lack thereof) like we do easily did with its predecessor. The movie moved into the Coliseum quite fast, and characters glinted in and out without a major connection to the audience. However, Scott paid homage to the past and provided some awesome plot twists along the way which locked me back in. Denzel helps carry the film, but Pascal could have if given more of an opportunity. Still a great flick to have on the arsenal!"", 'This was an amazing movie. The storyline fit perfectly along with the first one. Denzel and Paul did an amazing job in this film. The fact that this is set 16 years after the first one is interesting. The cinematography, the costumes, and the musical score was incredible. I must say there are some parts and some characters you know similar to certain parts in certain characters of the first Gladiator. But in my opinion, it works and it works really well. Parts of the first movie are brought in as a reminders of what led up to certain parts in this film. Ridley Scott is an amazing director and pulled this off.', ""When this movie got announced I believe we all wondered the same thing. HOW is it going to stand next to the masterpiece called The Gladiator? To be brutally honest I had kind of low expectations for the movie. I believed that it would be silly and Paul Mescal as Lucius would be quite underwhelming. The movie exceeded my expectations. It is a film with phenomenal performances mainly from Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal and Denzel Washington, that definitely gets you instantly bonded with the characters (one of the reasons why it is a blessing for this movie to be carrying the name of it's precurssor). However one of the main reasons that make me appreciate the movie more than I would is the fact that it almost brings back elements of the old cinema -when Gladiator released-. When explosions and 2 hours of raw action followed by an uninteresting plot wasn't the case in 70% of the action movies. When lines, details and character-relationship development used to matter waaaay more than they do now. And of course the movie doesn't contain these a lot...The philosophy and fan-base of modern cinema doesn't allow it to be so...However even seeing movies kind of wanting to bring that kind back does good to cinema. Anyways, the movie is not better than the first, they can barely be compared. However you should learn to judge things in life completely independently, only then will you realise their value. And INDEPENDENTLY Gladiator II is a very nice movie that may lack a bit on the plot and may be kind of silly at times but it definitely manages to stand decently to one of the greatest movies of all time. You should definitely see this movie\n\nP.

The guy playing the lead character, Paul Mescal, is hopelessly out of his depth, has no depth or presence, is wooden & insipid, and just doesn't make it work.

I honestly believe that the only thing that resembles anything from the first legendary movie is Denzel's role as the villain and probably also Emperor Geta.\n\nThe rest of the movie is a poor copy paste.\n\nI really hope that cinema will return to its past glory days.

As for the Emperor Penguins let's say, it's hard to believe any subjects obey, as they act more like clowns, leaves observer with frowns, in a film that looks good, but is only ok.\n\nWatched in an IMAX, great cinematography, costumes were spectacular, alas the story failed to meet expectations."", ""Denzel Washington is fantastically entertaining and the opening sequence with Paul Mescal and Yuval Gonen showed such promise, but it's no good, they rinsed the IP dry and I wish Ridley Scott had focused on his Napoleon Director's Cut, which I imagine will be so much more interesting. This is the opposite, the story is obscure and hollow, a classic example of studio box-ticking, an unbelievable amount of money and talent wasted on something so unoriginal you could watch the trailer, imagine yourself through the entire film and save yourself over 2 hours with change. It's one saving grace could have been spectacle, and yet somehow the effects are really nothing special, they are unremarkable, I felt like I was watching a video game narrative.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with telling the same stories over and over that's culture, but you need to bring something new and different each time, you want to refresh, not just run an old story through a regenerative workshop so you can sell it all over again, that's the opposite of refreshing."", ""I was excited for this flim from watching the 1st one I had High expectations from director riedly Scott.

You all probably think The View is a good tv show."", ""Ridley Scott actually tries his best with this movie. The movie is a non stop action sequence, with action sequences that defy anything the original did, thanks to the use of CGI that didn't exist back in the day (actually used well in this film, as I usually think that CGI looks terrible).\n\nThe problem is that the original was carried by stellar actors (Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, etc) and a plot which was entertaining despite being historical nonsense.\n\nYou have none of that in this film. The characters are uninteresting, the main character (Maximus' son) is not compelling or charismatic like Russell Crowe was, and the main villain (Denzel Washington) is nowhere near as interesting as Commodus was, and could almost be a minor villain (he also dies like one).\n\nThe plot, when you remove the action sequences, is also nonexistent. But this is a trend in recent films by Ridley Scott like Napoléon. There are lots of very impressive epic sequences, but when you look at the writing and plot (the actual meat and quality of a film) there is nothing.\n\nI think that Ridley Scott tries too much to emulate the first film here. The way the plot happens is quite similar (MC finds himself in the arena) but the villains and writing is sub par and forgettable.\n\nI feel that the problem is lack of originality. The actors have the talent, but the writing isn't there. Ridley Scott should have made a sequel that wasn't necessarily about Gladiators maybe, but something set in Roman times but elsewhere (for example in Judea or Germania/Britannia).\n\nDon't get me wrong, my dopamine addled brain, which enjoys a burger and a coca cola, somewhat enjoyed this film. But it's nothing more than that. Some critics call it a Marvel type film and I agree.\n\nGone are the monologues by tragic and mad characters (Joaquin Phoenix) with an amazing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. The original was not a masterpiece of writing but it had flair and charisma. This film has none of that. Unfortunately I think it's a trend where Ridley Scott simply lost his touch (Alien Covenant, Napoléon, and now this). His only recent good film was the Last Duel, precisely because he explored an entirely new setting and story (medieval France)."", 'It has been a long time since i\'ve watched a film from this genre, especially by a director this incredible. Oh how i missed such films. I enjoyed the film from beginning to end, found myself building ties and emotions with the characters and was never bored or exhausted of the plot.

The storyline extends from the original, but has its own uniqueness, style and ambience. I agree the script could\'ve had greater depth and there are several ways to enhance the plot, but i am genuinely impressed and pleased with the film as is also. This is a film i can rewatch several times and enjoy. Ridley scott, thank you for this.', ""Gladiator II feels like one big cliché, reminiscent of the revival of the Star Wars franchise.\n\nThe story follows an almost identical narrative to Gladiator I but goes completely over the top with CGI effects, featuring water-flooded arenas, battles with armored rhinos, and baboons.\n\nWhile Commodus in the first film was a genuinely terrifying villain, his reincarnations in the sequel-Emperors Caracalla and Geta-come across as clownish. At no point do they feel menacing; instead, they seem to serve more of a comedic purpose.\n\nToward the end of the film, there's an interesting twist, but it comes too late to salvage the story from its formulaic structure.\n\nSolid performances keep the film somewhat afloat, and visually it is stunning. However, whereas Star Wars desperately needed a formulaic reboot after the failures of the prequels, this sequel feels like a missed opportunity. In an era where original stories are becoming increasingly rare, a more innovative narrative would have been much more fitting here. Moreover, it's puzzling why the filmmakers would discard all historical accuracy to invent their own story, especially when the Roman Empire is already brimming with fascinating tales waiting to be told."", 'This movie was one of the most anticipated releases, making its underperformance even more disappointing. Lucius\'s character lacked depth needed to make him a true hero. Instead of embodying strength or resolve, his attempts at humor felt out of place, especially knowing he was inevitably heading toward a grim fate in the story. The dialogues, which could have added weight to the narrative, fell flat, lacking the punch needed to engage the audience. On the positive side, the special effects and visuals were undeniably stunning, showcasing impressive technical craftsmanship. However, despite these visual accomplishments, it seems Ridley Scott struggled to find his footing with this film. The storytelling and character development felt mismatched, leaving the overall experience underwhelming.

It's CGI you'd expect to have seen 20 years ago & really distracts from the whole spectacle.\n\nAs for the characters none of them are as good as their equivalents in the first film.

Where the original soared with emotional resonance, memorable characters, and a tightly crafted narrative, this follow-up stumbles under the weight of its ambition, delivering an uninspired and overblown spectacle.\n\nThe biggest flaw of *Gladiator 2* is its lack of a compelling narrative. While the original film thrived on Maximus's personal vendetta and moral struggle, the sequel fails to establish similarly strong stakes. The script feels disjointed, cobbled together with clichés and overly convoluted subplots that fail to evoke genuine investment. Rather than expanding the world of ancient Rome with depth and complexity, it falls into a trap of repetition, recycling themes and plot points from the original without adding anything truly new.\n\nThe characters in *Gladiator 2* are flat and underwritten, making it difficult to connect with their struggles. The protagonist lacks the gravitas and emotional depth that Russell Crowe brought to Maximus, and the supporting cast is largely wasted in forgettable roles. Even the villains fail to stand out, offering no memorable menace or intrigue to drive the drama forward.\n\nWhile the original *Gladiator* balanced its epic battle sequences with quiet, introspective moments, *Gladiator 2* leans too heavily on CGI-driven action. The fight scenes are relentless but lack the visceral intensity of the first film, coming across as overproduced and emotionally hollow. The visual effects, though polished, often feel excessive and distract from the narrative, reducing the film to a series of flashy but meaningless set pieces.\n\nA sequel to *Gladiator* should have been an opportunity to explore new perspectives on ancient Rome, delve into untold aspects of its history, or craft a fresh and innovative story. Instead, the film plays it safe, relying on nostalgia and surface-level fan service rather than taking creative risks. This lack of ambition leaves the movie feeling derivative and uninspired.\n\nThe film struggles to maintain a consistent tone, swinging awkwardly between epic drama and unintentional camp. Attempts at poignant moments feel forced and unearned, while moments of levity or humor seem out of place in a film that should be steeped in gravitas.\n\nGladiator 2 had the potential to be a monumental sequel, but it ultimately fails to capture the magic of the original. Its lackluster script, shallow characters, and overindulgence in spectacle result in a film that feels more like a generic historical action movie than a continuation of one of cinema's great epics. Fans of the original may find some moments of nostalgia, but overall, this is a disappointing and unnecessary follow-up that falls far short of its lofty expectations."", ""It's Cecil B. DeMille on steroids. It's huge, it's loud, has a great cast and I certainly felt very much entertained.\n\nWhereas Russel Crowe's Maximus in 'Gladiator' came from greatness, the protagonist here, intensely played by Paul Mescal, becomes greatness as the movies evolves. There are some impressive setpieces sprinkled throughout the runtime, and I got to say that Ridley Scott really redeems himself here, after last years incoherent dud, 'Napoleon'. 'Gladiator II' will most certainly be a contender at the Oscars next year in several categories. Denzel, for example, steals every scene he is in.\n\nThe real sets (built in both Malta and Morocco) looked really, really impressive and give that kind of immersion that CGI can't, although CGI certainly was used in several scenes either to add layers or create ships, monkeys or sharks (!)\n\nExcept the fact that Mescal doesn't carry as much weight and has as much screen presence as Crowe doing Maximus, and that it only had a Hans Zimmer-vibe, musicwise, instead of the real thing (or person), I came away thinking that this was probably the best time I had at a movie theater this year."", 'Like anybody else, i expected a movie worthy as its predecesor. But having seen Ridley late movies, i have doubts in my mind. The movie turned out to be what close to what i expected. When it comes for the battle scene, the action, the visual, they were outstanding, You have to admit Ridley is the master for this.\n\nBut i just feel the dialog, the character development, the drama scenes are too rushed.\n\nJust a bit of dialog scene here, a bit of dialog scene there, and then go to action scene. There were no bridge between them. Those are the things that this movie lacks of compared to the first one.\n\nI think Ridley or the editor just too concern about the action scene.', ""I watched the premiere in Sydney. The plot is richer and more emotional than the first one. Everyone's acting is great, Paul did a wonderful job! Denzel has a great talent for comedy and contributed a lot of funny plots. I personally feel that it is not bloody at all. There are many fighting scenes and it is very cool. The ending is very emotional and there are many touching parts.\n\nTo sum up the shortcomings: 1. Some dialogue editing switches too frequently. I personally don't like this editing method. I prefer to use a slightly longer shot to focus on one person (preferably the main character) so that I can capture the slight changes in the person's facial during the dialogue.\n\n2. The sea water in front is a bit too real to makes it look fake. The sea water is too blue and perfect, which often presents the opposite effect.\n\n3. Regarding historical rationality, I don't think people at that time had a certain understanding of the concept and appearance of the god of death. (I'm not sure)\n\np. S. This is a script adapted from history. There is no need to care about the originality of the script. Therefore, it's unnecessary to care about whether the second one is a remake of the first one. People say that they want to see a sequel but don't want the script to be too related to the previous one. This statement itself is contradictory. If we must see a completely different story, then we should list it as an original script. But the second one clearly states that it is an adaptation. You can judge the adaptation of the script, but if you are not satisfied with its originality, maybe you should rewrite the history book.\n\nMy ratings in various dimensions: Writing: 9.5/10 Direction: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Acting: 10/10 Editing: 7.5/10 Sound:10/10 Score/Soundtrack: 10/10 Production Design: 9.5/10 Casting: 10/10 Effects: 8/10 Hair and Make Up: 9.5/10 Costume Design: 9.5/10."", ""I start with saying that Gladiator 2 is not a 'bad' movie per say. It has good casting, good scenes, a couple of very good scenes and even strokes of genius here and there, but for all its positives Gladiator suffers from the same issues most 'late blooming' modern sequels suffer from: cliches, the ever abhorable fan-services and needless, scenes.\n\nGladiator had a very tight script, every scene, every dialogue spoken built it upwards until it culminated in the masterpiece it was. Nothing felt needless.\n\nGladiator 2 suffers from lesser quality script, needless and predictable cliche and fan-service scenes (which were absent from the original thankfully), needless call-backs (that only diminish the originals value, instead of raising up the sequel to it) and other such faults.\n\nIt is a bit baffling how such great and such poor scenes and moments are in the same movie.\n\nIts worth a watch, its entertaining, but it does not live up to its predecessor by any means."", 'Directed by Ridley Scott, the movie centers on Lucius (played by Paul Mescal), whose homeland has been conquered by the tyrannical emperors now ruling Rome with an iron fist. Fueled with rage in his heart and the future of the Empire at stake, He must look to his past to find strength and honor to return the glory of Rome to its people.\n\nIt\'s interesting; I just realized that this year, we got a chance to see both sequels from movies that honestly didn\'t need one it\'s Joker: Folie à Deux and Gladiator II. What\'s interesting is that, so far, we know which one gets more praise than the other, I think it shows how to make a worthy sequel if it can\'t quite live up to its predecessor. I honestly didn\'t want Ridley to continue his 2000s Roman epic because while it opened a door for more stories to tell, it was such a perfect end for the characters. It wasn\'t much of a surprise when they announced Gladiator II; I mean, it\'s common news from big studios nowadays.\n\nYou can\'t compare this with the first one, you just can\'t because it\'s much more different than it\'s similar. Sure, it has the same main trope, but Gladiator II has a more layered story than before, with more characters involved in the story. That being said, I feel that is the weakest point about it, probably because one of the characters that they keep showing in the promos feels somewhat wasted. I\'m trying to keep this spoiler-free, but these days, it seems like killing off characters is a common way to dispose of them. I\'ve heard people complaining about the fight between animals and humans; I actually like the idea because, 20 years later, with these technological advancements, Ridley and his team are just going crazy with the action sequences. Big Rhino, Baboons? Why the heck not? Also, brace yourself before witnessing the opening scene; Ridley immediately lets you know that ain\'t playing around.\n\nLucius is not Maximus and Paul Mescal is no Russell Crowe. But I would be lying if he didn\'t give an impressive performance. I\'ll just say this, though, throughout the movie, he tries to channel his inner ""Maximus,"" and in the final moments, he finally does it without losing himself. Maximus would be proud of him. Denzel Washington is Denzel Washington. What more needs to be said? His character is one of the best, fun parts (whatever it is) of the movie.\n\nGladiator II is probably my number 1 movie of the year in terms of pure entertainment. Sure, there\'s Dune: Part Two, which was released earlier this year, and then Furiosa just to name a few. But none of them come close to this, I\'m very entertained. I hadn\'t been born yet when the original was released in theaters, but when I heard the iconic score ""Now We Are Free"" playing at the end, along with the memorable opening shot from the first movie, it gave me goosebumps and made me feel nostalgic. ""Talk to me Father"", that line almost made me weep.', ""Wasn't expecting it to better the first but I was at least expecting it to be well made & written.\n\nPoor acting all round apart from Pedro Pascal, the lead role I didn't buy into at all. Story line especially towards the end felt completely farfetched and even comedic.\n\nGladiator 2 didn't grab your emotions in 99% of the scenes unlike the first.\n\nMany scenes ruined by CGI apart from Rome itself.\n\nIt could have been made well as the initial plot was something to go off but it just spiralled down a complete mess of a storyline combined with bad acting, bad fight scenes and a bad experience in general.\n\nI'm sorry to say Gladiator 2 was lifeless."", 'This is a good movie and way better than I expected it to be. I would recommend the thumbs up positive reviews from Richard Roeper, Entertainment Weekly, and the New York Times, since I agreed with their reviews after watching it. Apparently, it\'s popular to bash it for not being as good as the original (apparently the original is a perfect movie, a ""masterpiece"" (eyeroll) to many, and while it\'s a good movie, it\'s probably overrated if hyperbolically viewed that way), but it\'s a very entertaining movie and story that many people are going to like. Just watch it with low expectations and you will enjoy everything that makes a an action packed historical Roman epic worthwhile.', ""Gladiator 2 is a worthy sequel and borrows a lot from the first, which in this case isn't a bad thing! The second part lacks the emotions of the first but makes up for it with the stunning battle sequences, especially in the coliseum! This movie deserves to be seen in theaters! Ridley Scott delivers again! Denzel Washington was the standout actor for me and deserves an Oscar nomination! All in all, it's a great time at the movies! At two and a half hours, it is long but somehow feels rushed. When impactful things happen, it moves on a bit too quickly in my opinion. If you liked the first, you'll probably like the second! Definitely recommend!"", ""Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000) was an epic masterpiece, a film that combined thrilling action sequences with a powerful story of revenge and redemption. The film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe, and it has since become a classic.\n\nSo, when it was announced that Scott was returning to the world of gladiatorial combat with a sequel, expectations were high. Unfortunately, Gladiator II fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. The film is a pale imitation of the original, lacking the heart, soul, and epic scope that made Gladiator so memorable.\n\nA Shallow Spectacle\n\nOne of the biggest problems with Gladiator II is that it lacks a compelling protagonist. Paul Mescal, who plays Lucius, the nephew of Commodus, is a bland and uncharismatic lead. He simply does not have the screen presence or acting chops to carry a film of this magnitude.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally underwhelming. Denzel Washington, who plays a gladiator trainer, is wasted in a role that is beneath his talents. Connie Nielsen, who reprises her role as Lucilla, is given little to do.\n\nThe film's plot is also a major disappointment. The story is predictable and uninspired, and it lacks the emotional depth of the original. The action sequences, while technically well-made, are also less impactful than those in the first film.\n\nMissing the Mark\n\nGladiator II feels like a cynical attempt to cash in on the success of the original. The film lacks the passion and artistry that made Gladiator so special. It is a hollow spectacle that will likely disappoint fans of the original.\n\nHere are some of the specific criticisms of the film:\n\nWeak protagonist: Paul Mescal is miscast as Lucius. He lacks the charisma and screen presence of Russell Crowe.\n\nUninspired plot: The story is predictable and unoriginal.\n\nUnderutilized supporting cast: Denzel Washington and Connie Nielsen are wasted in their roles.\n\nLack of emotional depth: The film fails to connect with the audience on an emotional level.\n\nOverreliance on CGI: The film's action sequences are overly reliant on CGI, which makes them less impactful.\n\nOverall, Gladiator II is a major disappointment. It is a pale imitation of the original that lacks the heart, soul, and epic scope that made Gladiator so memorable."", ""I wanted to see a nod of appreciation for Maximus and his life. I got it. His dream is alive and in all the fights in the arena and off it, the betrayels, the manipulation, the plans and the hope, somehow Maximus son must win.\n\nThe visuals are very good, the music, the acting, the story, for me delivered. It's not a masterpiece, but neither was Gladiator 1.\n\nConnie Nielsen brought the nostagia, Denzel was perfect as always. Pedro did a very good job. He was nuanced and complex. Paul Mescal i think did a good job. I didn't want him to try and be Maximus. We have one. He did a good job.\n\nThis movies knows about the love Gladiato 1 got, and wanted to add to the story, not re-do it.\n\nSo yes. I enjoied the movie. Nice."", ""Remember the beginning of the first Gladiator, the battle against the barbarians , the mood the environment, the battle Richard Harris .\n\nThat was an epic .\n\nAfter Alien, Blade Runner, Black Hank Down, Thelma and a Louise Ridley Scott lost his touch.\n\nHe's still on of the best directors of all time , but since American Gangster , his films lost Midas touch.\n\nEverything in this film is tedious, repetitive and boring.\n\nThe same plot same conclusion .\n\nA big desapointment.\n\nEveryone talks about Denzel Washington performance and I don't know why.\n\nAnd the shark tank sequence was so ridiculous.\n\nThis sequel was a mistake .\n\nI will see again the first Gladiator had great."", ""Ridley Scott, what a piece of rubbish you threw together. Days of our lives acting, quick cut fight scenes, non-sense action environments and poor character development. From such a masterpiece 24 years ago, why even ruin your name on this historical debacle.\n\nIs this just the world we live in now. How does this make cinema. There must be some system that someone reads the script and watches the filming before release. Is the plan just do throw money at Denzel and Pedro in hope they bring the numbers. The original had a fairly green cast and the movie made them superstars. Superstars don't make great movies all the time."", ""This movie has many good effects and some decent fight scenes. But that is all what is good about it. There are too many names and one big mistake - Lucius's relation to Maximus. For those who haven't seen the first Gladiator, it may be ok. But for its true fans it is so wrong. Lucius claims (at least several times) that Maximus was his father. It is very misleading. The first Gladiator movie clearly shows that Maximus had his own son (who was nearly 8 years old) and wife who were killed. And Lucilla had her son Lucius who was also nearly 8 (she told it herself during her conversation with Maximus). And this move somehow manages to connect Maximus with Lucius as a father and son. That is huge disrespect to the original Gladiator. Maximus should be mentioned as a great warrior and figter, but not as Lucius's father. So for the fans of the first movie it may be impossible to understand those strange expressions and strange relations."", ""There are movies that should be left as it is, shouldn't be touched for remake or sequel, Gladiator is one of those. The sequel struggles to match the emotional and dramatic impact of the original, falling short of the iconic status of its predecessor. Totally forgettable, 24yrs from now we would still be talking about Gladiator not this. That said, as a standalone film, it's not that disappointing like contemporary movies. Performances are okay, and makes you miss Russell Crowe and his iconic lines and way of delivering them. Only perfect thing was Denzel Washington. Denzel being Denzel, as always adds depth, dimensions to his characters. His character, with its compelling lines delivered in true Denzel fashion, might even earn him another Oscar.\n\nIf only we could have witnessed a crossover of Denzel's character and Crowe's Maximus in the same film-now that would have been a something !"", ""After 24 years, Ridley Scott decides to continue the story of one of his best films focusing on Maximus' son. It was not an easy thing knowing that Maximus' family had been executed in the previous film, but Ridley took advantage of two elements from the previous film for this new story. The previous film has never told anything about Lucius' father and the kiss between Maximus and Lucilla indicated that at some point they were lovers when Maximus was still under the service of Aurelius. With these ambiguous details it was enough to create this story focused on Lucius to make a direct connection with the previous film without having to create a derivative story. Ridley Scott knew how to create a sequel that remains well linked to the canon of the previous film and it was something that was already planned since the release of the first film. Carrying out this project took too long because DreamWorks had sold the rights to Paramount. Lucius, Lucilla and Graco are the only characters that connect with the previous film. It's clear that a lot has happened because the story is set 16 years after Maximus' triumph. Rome is now under the control of two twin emperors who are clearly inspired by Caligula in their attitude. Like the previous film, there are betrayals and a conspiracy to overthrow the tyrannical government. Basically, it's like the story from the previous film is repeated, but in a different way. What sets this film apart from its predecessor is that there are more action scenes and more blood. Gladiator reflected the brutality and corruption of the Roman Empire. In this film that is doubled by showing a more raw image of the brutality of that time. The film follows much the same path as the Spartacus series. There is more focus on action making the story feel a little shorter, but you can appreciate the fight of the gladiators a lot more. Admittedly, the production quality is better than the previous film, although both are still an excellent representation of Rome in its days as a world power. While Gladiator was somewhat of a worthy revival for epic cinema, Gladiator 2 is a terrific sequel that lives up to its predecessor. The original film may not have needed a sequel at the time, but the fact that a sequel came out over 20 years later has given us a renewed appreciation for the work that Russell Crowe has become so popular for. My final rating for this film is a 10/10."", ""Watch this movie, if you...\nan easy movie that is emotionally easy\nwant to see Denzel Washington in a unusual role\nlike action and fighting scenes\nare nostalgic due to gladiator.\n\n\nDon't want to watch it, if you...\nwant a movie that is historical highly correct\nlove character development and depth\n\n\nIn short, I did not regret the movie, but after a short I knew that this will not be one of the movies I will tell my grandchildren about. They tried to create a historical atmosphere, but the most annoying thing was that most characters acted not like I thought historical figures would act. Some movie plots were naive in my view."", ""Giving this an 8/10 rating\n\nBeen a long time coming, if ever thought there could or would be a second film, and it's well worth seeing, was way better than I hoped for and was not a single moment was boring, in fact, it went by so quick I could of done with a bit more!\n\nThe film as you expect has plenty of death, and like the last one, political intrigue, which is the main force of the story and revenge, plenty of that to go around. Paul mescal really does prove without a doubt, he is more than a match for anyone one acting. Denzel Washington and Pedro Pascal with Connie Nielsen bring weight and power for their performances and the film, Joseph Quinn along with Fred Hechinger as the mad Emperors, are just a blast. To be really fair, this time every character gets good screen time in this, second team up of director Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa, both worked on 'Napoleon', last year.\n\nA much cleaner look than 'Gladiator' is thanks to digital, and time, and probably what was learnt from 'Napoleon'. And help with writers Peter Craig and David Franzoni tie it all up nicely. It's pure entertainment at cinema and good strong story telling. Needs a second watch."", ""It's like the original but worse is the best way I would describe it. This movie lacks emotion, it lacks any depth, it's something I would turn on in the background and keep it running. I have no idea why they made a sequel it had a perfect ending and the story was done. If this was a rome with with a different name it would have been a 4, only reason is they reused a bunch of stuff from the original.\n\nI'm not sure what's going on with Ridley Scott, it just seems like he's rushing these movies out and just forgot something, this movie just ignores tons of plot holes and decides to throw you into action. The cgi fest is strong with this one, you got chunky rhinos for no reason and sharks now to help you ignore the story being so bad ."", ""To my surprise, Gladiator II did not explicitly copy the themes and narrative of the original. Going into the film with low expectations, I found that the political theming really drove my interest in the plot. While the original film revolved more around a singular character and his endeavor to obtain revenge, Gladiator II expands its focus to the system as a whole. Violence was an entertainment enterprise at the time and it was interesting to see the shift of power as the desires of the masses changed. However, this exploration of multiple characters and their motivations did make some sequence feel rushed.\n\nOverall, I personally enjoyed the Gladiator II just as much as the original. Both films have similar aspects no doubt, but there is enough variation to understand the reason why Ridley Scott wanted to make a second film. Now we just have to wait for the director's cut. Who knows, maybe a directors cut would surprise us just like Kingdom of Heaven."", ""I want to express my disappointment with Gladiator II, as it fails to match the brilliance of Gladiator 1. Despite being directed by the same visionary, Ridley Scott, many scenes in the sequel feel illogical and inconsistent. For instance, the lake scene, with sharks inexplicably present. Additionally, the incorporation of unnecessary fantastical elements strays from the grounded, epic tone that made the original a masterpiece. If the sequel had retained the same level of depth and focus on storytelling as the legendary tale of Maximus in the first film, it could have honored its predecessor far better. Sadly, the movie feels disappointing and falls short of expectations. Here's hoping future projects show more restraint and fidelity to the qualities that made the first film unforgettable."", 'The film\'s reliance on CGI, notably the inclusion of computer-generated baboons, fails to add depth, instead highlighting the superficiality of the narrative. The characters lack substance, rendering their journeys unengaging. Despite the cast\'s commendable efforts, the weak script hampers their performances, reducing the film to a series of disjointed action sequences. The score, unable to match the original\'s impact, further diminishes the sequel\'s appeal. While ""Gladiator II"" offers some visual thrills, it ultimately feels like a pale imitation of the original, lacking the heart and soul that made its predecessor a classic.', ""The film is entertaining enough and improves in the final third when it moves away from the plot retread of the first film. And here lies the issue; it simply does not compare to the first film. Mescal does not have the fierce gravitas of Russell Crowe and he isn't helped by having to repeat some of the earlier films dialog.\n\nFor British viewers the appearance of Matt Lucas (Little Britain) and Tim Mcinnerny (Blackadder) is faintly ludicrous and makes it feel like Carry On Gladiator.\n\nCan we also mention the monkey dog thing and the sharks? Really?\n\nOverall a partial misfire and may appeal more to those with no knowledge of the power of the first film,"", ""Ridley Scott's Gladiator 2 captivates with breathtaking visuals and dynamic action sequences, vividly bringing ancient Rome to life. The cinematography and set design are stunning, immersing the audience in the grandeur of the era. However, the film falters with a predictable plot and underdeveloped characters, leaving viewers emotionally detached. The new characters lack depth and compelling motivations, making it hard to form a connection. Despite its technical brilliance, the weak storytelling undermines the film's emotional impact. Gladiator 2 is a visual spectacle but falls short of the narrative strength and emotional resonance of its predecessor."", '## Review of ""Gladiator II""\n\n""Gladiator II,"" directed by Ridley Scott, is an engaging sequel set 16 years after the original. Following Lucius Verus (Paul Mescal), the film explores themes of power and redemption in a politically charged Rome.\n\nThe action sequences are thrilling, showcasing impressive choreography and visuals that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Denzel Washington delivers a standout performance as Macrinus, complemented by Pedro Pascal\'s strong portrayal.\n\nHowever, the film struggles to escape the shadow of its predecessor. While it has emotional moments, it lacks the depth and iconic score of the original. Overall, ""Gladiator II"" is a solid watch for fans, but it doesn\'t quite reach the heights of its legendary predecessor.', ""Gladiator 2 is an amazing sequel that delivers epic visuals, powerful performances, and a gripping story. While it doesn't fully match the emotional depth of the first film and some moments don't make complete sense, it still pulls you in and keeps you hooked.\n\nThe film follows or borrows elements from the first movie's script in some areas, but this doesn't make it feel repetitive or like a poor imitation. Instead, it honors the original while carving its own path.\n\nWith stunning set pieces and an engaging plot, it's a worthy continuation of the original. Fans of Gladiator should definitely watch it-it's a thrilling and unforgettable experience."", ""I've been eagerly awaiting Gladiator II since it was announced, but sadly, it didn't live up to the original masterpiece. While the first film delivered a gripping and emotional story that still resonates today, the sequel leaned heavily on spectacle. It's entertaining enough for a cinema visit, but its reliance on flashy graphics and CGI means it'll likely feel dated in just a few years.\n\nThe movie tries to tie itself to the original with subtle nods and packs in several subplots, but none of them carry the depth needed to truly connect with the audience. The characters felt shallow, and their performances often seemed forced - everyone was too busy trying to look cool, cry prettily, or be over-the-top. This is in stark contrast to Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe's natural and believable portrayals in the original.\n\nOn top of that, the historical inaccuracies were glaring, making it hard for history buffs to stay immersed. While Gladiator II isn't a complete miss and works for a one-time watch, it lacks the timeless quality and emotional weight of its predecessor. Disappointing, to say the least."", ""The original Gladiator is a timeless classic, hailed as the best movie of its year by the Academy. Gladiator 2 is a completely different beast, a fun-filled popcorn flick perfect for a mindless weekend escape.\n\nSurprisingly, Gladiator 2 manages to be an exceptionally entertaining popcorn movie, even for those who hold the original in high regard. With its over-the-top characters, exaggerated action, and overall lighthearted tone, it's the perfect choice for a fun-filled weekend.\n\nLet's face it, I'm not holding my breath for an Oscar here. Perhaps a technical nomination, but that's about it.\n\nHighly recommended!

What role does cuisine play in her identity, and how does it conflict with her personal struggles? By not focusing more on this aspect, the film misses an opportunity to add depth to her character. It would have helped to not only connect the viewer more to her journey but also to make her internal conflict about balancing career and family feel more urgent and relatable.\n\nProduct Placement: A Bite of Distraction\n\nLet\'s talk about the Weetabix moments. When the product literally becomes part of the conversation, it feels like the movie just took a quick break to sell us breakfast. It\'s the kind of moment that makes you wonder, ""How much did Weetabix pay for this?"" It didn\'t ruin the film, but I definitely could\'ve done without the mid-movie snack ad.\n\nStrong Performances Hold it Together\n\nDespite its shortcomings, We Live in Time is held together by the incredible performances of Garfield and Pugh. Their chemistry alone makes the film worth watching. Both actors manage to convey raw emotion with depth, carrying the weight of the film\'s emotional core.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the end, We Live in Time isn\'t a revolutionary film, but it is a heartfelt one. It\'s a deeply personal story of love, time, and loss, and while it doesn\'t always land every emotional beat, it still offers moments of real beauty. If you\'re a fan of character-driven romances and strong performances, this film is worth a watch.', 'Never has the gap between my expectations and the actual impact of the film been so vast. The possibilities were so high with casting two of the greatest actors of our time- and even they could not make the movie have a soul. The writing and soundtrack were totally forgettable, despite Pugh and Garfield putting in great performances of what was available to them. The back and forth timeline made for an incomplete emotional journey, as there was no build up or stakes to be invested in. Both characters fell very flat, and I felt very little emotional investment in them. I had such high hopes and was counting down the days for this film, and was sorely disappointed upon leaving the screening. Hope someone casts the two together in a future film and gives them a better opportunity to create a masterpiece.', ""I just got done watching We Live in Time (2024) and I got to tell you that this is genuinely one of the most emotionally and realistic romance movies I've seen in recent memory.\n\nPositives for We Live in Time (2024): The leading performances from both Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh are phenomenal in this movie. That really isn't surprising given these two have been nominated for Oscars in the past and I hope they both get nominations this year. I appreciated that this movie manage to tell a love story of two strangers falling in love with each other after meeting for the first time in a realistic way. Now don't get me wrong, I do enjoy my fair share of romance movies where the two lovers meet up in the most cynical and ridiculous way possible, but at the same time I do like it when a movie approaches these stories in a more realistic fashion. The things these two character go through in this movie all manage to be heartwarming, devastating and even wholesome depending on what scenes these moments are taking place. I also appreciated that this movie manages to keep the balance during these moments to where they don't feel overly dramatic or overly emotional to the point where it feel like cringe. And finally, I love how the movie's ending manages to avoided the all of the traditional cliches of other romance movies while also giving the audience the satisfaction they want to see in this movie.\n\nMixed for We Live in Time (2024): While I certainly appreciated the route this movie took with its story, there are going to be some people who are probably going to have a hard time watching this movie. Now to be fair, the movie did achieve its primary goals with the approach, but it also might hit hard for some people who have gone through similar situations in their lives.\n\nNegatives for We Live in Time (2024): I only have one thing to say about this movie in this area and it's very small. This is a movie that I can only see myself watching once and that's it. But, if this element is the only negative with your movie, then that tells you how good your movie is.\n\nOverall, We Live in Time (2024) definitely gave me what I wanted and I couldn't be any happier about that. If Garfield and Pugh don't get nominations for their performances in this movie, then I'll be very disappointed with the Academy. Regardless, if you're looking for a romance movie that feels genuinely realistic with its approach to the story, then this is the movie for you."", ""We Live In Time is a fantastic, well-made film filled with humor, heart, and a gut punch of emotional weight. Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield give incredible raw performances that should have plenty of talk come award season. Their chemistry and play off each other really made the film tug at the heart strings.\n\nThe story is told well, in a slightly different way than expected that works perfectly for the film. These characters and this world feel real and the film has you invested from the moment it begins.\n\nPack the tissues and be prepared to be taken on a journey.\n\nWe Live In TIme is well worth the time and is one of the year's best films."", ""Saw this at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nJohn Crowley crafts a simple and predictable romance story that isn't really anything special, yet, captures a beautifully looking presentation with two strong performances from Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh throughout. Frankly, sometimes, we need to enjoy a simple cheesy romance narrative and We Live in Time checkbooks out of the cheese elements together pretty well. With good music, simple dialogue, and structure, it still holds an emotional connect with it's viewers as the chemistry and banter between the two leads are watchable and good.\n\nObviously, because of it's predictable style, it does feel a bit long with it's pacing and certain elements may put you to snooze, but as a whole, Crowley's direction and Garfield and Pugh's performance kept it running."", ""Well, it was definitely an enjoyable film to watch with a lot of other people. Lots of people in the audience laughing and crying. I didn't feel emotionally wrecked - I felt uplifted by the performances I saw - Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh are both wonderful in this film. They are just so good together - a real sense of trust between them. I heard a man exiting festival hall sarcastically saying to his friend 'and she just happened to be a world class chef... ' I didn't mind any of that because I believed her. I don't want to see a film abt normal boring life - I want escapism, romance, something other than my life but based in truth. A domestic drama but between two beautiful people. I'd definitely watch it again - the time flew by."", ""This show has a lot going for it.\n\nA fantastic blown out of the water cast.\n\nBeautiful destination locations for shooting.\n\nThe two leads have fantastic chemistry.

There are even some good laughs here!\n\nAndrew Garlfields character is especially great.\n\nAlthough... his character may be great because I feel so much sympathy for the guy. Like sympathy one has for the abused dogs in the Sarah McLaughlin commercials. Why? Because Florence Pughs character walks ALL over this holy sweetheart of a man.\n\nFlorence Pughs character takes the role of protagonist in the film. The films fatal flaw is that it makes you hate her. Any emotion I was supposed to have, was washed over with a scathing dislike and head scratching confusion over the writing decisions made. The film starts strong but goes in a sour emotionless direction. Even the films core message is overshadowed by its poor writing that leads it there. All were seen leaving the theater severely unsatisfied."", 'I saw it for Andrew Garfield , one of magnificient actors of present , for John Crowley , in memory of their fantastic film Boy A.\n\nAnd, indeed, We Live in Time is a pure beautiful film. Its first virtue is the kick to viewer to discover his past moments and future perspectives. The second virtue is represented by acting. I do not ignore romance or problems of life together or the knife of near death.\n\nBut it is a profound subjective masterpiece for the fine portrait of ages. For message, to. For the honest definition of unique moments of life. And for the fantastic performance of Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield .\n\nSo, see it !', ""I am speechless at how amazing Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh were in this movie. Outstanding performances! Their chemistry and onscreen relationship was perfection! An emotional film obviously because of the subject it was about, but portrayed excellently, with some funny parts also. Both actors deserve an Oscar for this film! These are 2 actors who can play any role flawlessly. Still crying driving home after the movie and a film has never done that! A close to home subject also which probably doesn't help. Well done on this movie that portrays the struggles people are dealing with every single day! 10/10!!"", ""I went to see this movie during a free screening. I had high hopes since the two leads are phenomenal actors.\n\nI wanted to love this movie but it felt disjointed. Most movies where there's something mysterious/emotional that happens, there's a build up. You get to know the characters. You feel connected to them. In this case, there wasn't that build up. It was hard to really feel anything for what happens.\n\nI'm also not a fan of movies where they piece together multiple timelines that jumps back and forth. Especially when there's not much that allows you to recognize which timeline you're watching.\n\nThis movie was meant for Netflix, not the big screen."", 'Director John Crowley\'s heavily-schmaltzed Brit rom-drama ""We Live In Time"" covers the gamut of Andrew Garfield & Florence Pugh\'s relationship from \'meet cute\' thru parenthood to \'tear jerk ending\' (for those with easily jerkable tears) via Nick Payne\'s cleverly chopped non-linear screenplay (the film\'s strongest aspect). Along the way there are some strong scenes (like an incredibly visceral \'birth\' scene - with Kerry Godliman cameo) but overall it\'s relatively niche, and will appeal mainly to those who love the way the likes of ""The Notebook"" force the sentimentality with over-cooked dialogue & performances. Those who love it will love it, but beware, it won\'t be for all.', ""Honestly one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, I thought it was just a romance comedy but no this is way more than that, I have never teared up throughout an entire movie but this movie was something else, the entire 2 hours I was lost for words.\n\nOnce I started watching I got so deep into the story due to the non chronological order timeline which I know a lot of people didn't like but that was the reason I felt this movie was special.\n\nI watched it with my friend and this is something we never usually watch, last time we watched a movie it was the new bad boys. I chose this movie and she did not know at all what it was I knew it from the trailer that released 3 months ago. She ended up liking it a lot too. But for me I was shocked with how good it was, beyond my expectations.\n\nBeautiful movie about how life is with amazing moments. I still think about the movie and feel like I'll continue to think about it in the future.\n\nThe only movie that reminds me of Eternal Sunshine from its very beautiful real feeling love story and nonlinear timeline even thought there are very different reasons for the timeline to show in both movies. This movie will have a special place in my heart for years to come."", 'Director John Crowley\'s latest venture, ""We Live in Time,"" weaves a narrative that\'s as intricate as it is emotionally resonant. This film, which focuses on the tumultuous journey of love against the backdrop of time\'s relentless march, offers a blend of heartfelt moments and poignant reflections, though it occasionally stumbles in its ambition to transcend the conventional romance drama.\n\nPerformances: Florence Pugh delivers a tour de force as Almut, the ambitious chef whose life is turned inside out by love and illness. Pugh\'s portrayal is both fierce and vulnerable, capturing the essence of a woman who battles not just cancer but also the ticking clock of her own life. Andrew Garfield, as Tobias, provides a solid counterbalance, bringing depth to the role of a man who finds love when he least expects it. Their chemistry is palpable, fueling the film\'s emotional core.\n\nNarrative: The non-linear storytelling, while ambitious, is both a strength and a weakness. Crowley\'s decision to jump through time offers fresh perspectives on the same emotional beats, illustrating how memories shape our present. However, this structure sometimes disrupts the flow, leaving the audience momentarily adrift in the timeline. The film\'s attempt at modernity through this narrative technique feels slightly forced, yet it\'s intriguing enough to keep one invested.\n\nThemes: ""We Live in Time"" excels in exploring its central themes of mortality, love, and the human experience. The film poignantly questions what it means to live fully, especially when time is not on your side. This exploration is touching, often rendered beautifully through scenes of quiet intimacy or sudden, heart-wrenching clarity. The film\'s emotional peaks are its strongest suits, offering moments that linger long after the credits roll.\n\nVisuals and Score: Cinematographically, the film is polished, with each frame composed to evoke a sense of timelessness or urgency, fitting the narrative\'s ebb and flow. The score complements the visuals, enhancing the emotional undertones without overshadowing the dialogue or performances.\n\nConclusion: ""We Live in Time"" is a film that aspires to be both a love story and a meditation on life\'s impermanence. It succeeds more in the former than the latter, crafting a narrative that, while not groundbreaking, is deeply affecting. For those who appreciate a good cry paired with a thoughtful narrative, this film delivers. However, it might leave others wishing for a bit more innovation in its storytelling or deeper dives into its philosophical musings. A commendable effort, but one that leaves the door open for more exploration in the themes it so tenderly touches upon.', ""Can I just start off by saying the hype over this movie before it came out made me so skeptical. However, it's so eloquently written. Both Florence and Andrew did put on an exceptional performance truly showing the ups and downs of falling in love and the grief that follows loss. Andrew was the perfect cast, his true personality in real life reflected so deeply in his roll as Tobias. Not only do I highly recommend this movie but please do yourself a favor and bring some tissues. I smiled, I laughed, and I snot cried like a child. The best movie i've seen in '24 without a doubt. The cinematography was breathtaking! It felt like I was standing in the same room embodying their journey as if it were my own. As someone who's dealt with loss and love first hand it's so spot on it's not even funny. Florence was exceptionally beautiful and has this metamorphosis as an actress i've yet to see in any one of her previous roles. Truly gut wrenchingly beautiful."", 'Two thoughts.\n\nNot entirely sure what the out-of-sequence storytelling provides to the story. I\'m of the impression it at least doesn\'t seem to distract from one\'s ability to follow along.. as the story is not that complicated, and while it stands out, it is well woven together.\n\nI\'m also not completely sure about what the movie was trying to say.. or at least, it doesn\'t seem apparent to me with one watch (which is probably all I\'m giving this). I mean, it has some very heartfelt moments, great performances, memorable scenes, and VERY eventful.. and yet somehow empty (probably as life makes it feel sometimes). It does present ideas that I can see being discussed either way, hardships of life, and the give and take when two people intertwine. But is it more of an overlook than a vehicle for something more? It is quite clear that this is a story about her.. her choices, her struggles and what she leaves behind. There\'s also the idea of ""look at what is in front of me now, instead of thinking ahead"".\n\nAnyways, always enjoy Andrew Garfield, and miss Pugh has proven to be quite talented in such roles. There\'s a lot to take away from this, and I can\'t see it being executed better. If this is your genre, then go right ahead.', '""A Beautifully Heart-Wrenching Exploration of Love and Time""\n\nWe Live in Time is a deeply emotional masterpiece that shines through the powerful performances of Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh. Both actors give stunning portrayals of love, vulnerability, and the fleeting nature of time. Their chemistry is magnetic, drawing you into a heartfelt journey of highs and lows. The non-linear storytelling is unique, reflecting the unpredictable flow of memories and life\'s key moments. The film masterfully blends tender romance with intense drama, making you reflect on love, loss, and life\'s fragility. It\'s a truly unforgettable experience. An easy 10/10!', ""Tobias (Andrew Garfield) is hit by a car driven by Almut (Florence Pugh). She stays in the hospital until he wakes up and because - despite having a broken arm and being in a neck brace - he has already been discharged (there are not enough beds available - political comment there!) takes him to dinner. He is newly-divorced, she has just come out of a lesbian relationship. Despite this unpromising beginning, there is mutual attraction and the pair begin a years-long relationship.\n\nThe two leads make an engaging couple. Pugh, especially, is easy to accept as the fiery Almut. Garfield plays nice guy Tobias a bit too geeky to be completely believable, but he manages to stay on the right side of annoying (and, if the shapely bare buttocks in the bathroom scene belong to him and not to a body double, he has a very nice bottom - just saying...) No other actors get enough screen time to make an impact, although I was struck at seeing Douglas Hodge playing Tobias' father - twenty or thirty years ago, he would probably have been playing the male lead himself.\n\nThis is a good example of a chick flick: romantic, cheesy and leaving not a single dry eye in the house. I am not sure I would watch it again, but I am glad I saw it at least once."", '""We Live in Time"" is one of the most moving films I\'ve seen in a long time. The story of an up-and-coming chef and a recent divorcée struck me deeply. My wife and I were completely drawn into their world, feeling their highs and lows as if we were right there with them. The performances, especially by Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh, were so raw and emotional, it felt incredibly real. The way the story unfolded-jumping through moments in their lives-made the experience even more powerful. It\'s a beautiful reminder of how love, even through hardships, can leave an everlasting mark. The impact of the film lasted the rest of the day and we connected over the emotions of the film.', ""We Live In Time is a 2024 Romantic Comedy Drama starring Andrew Garfield as Tobias who works for Weetabix and Florence Pugh as Almut a respected chef and a former ice skater.

But the film is forgiven for it's humour and decent performances from all involved. There's definitely that rom-com tone throughout, even though it's mixed into a drama with all these scenes that are all over the place, but I think it's definitely realistic and well made in regards to the genre.\n\nThe dialogue, while rusty at times, still does it's job and scattered jokes there and there always are a fine addition. In terms of performances, Andrew Garfield is ok as he has some comedic and dramatic scenes but I think Florence Pugh really stands out with her strong dialogue and especially being very believable. I can definitely see her get nominated here, but I think for the most part everyone did what they did and I don't think this is a film you should take too seriously as it's just what it is on paper, a rom-com drama.\n\nOverall, while nothing particularly unique is added to the format, We Live In Time is an enjoyable one to watch with a friend and holds it's audience's attention throughout the film with it's comedic and dramatic elements that make a film like this fun for most people on a night out, definitely recommend.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nLondon Film Festival 18th October."", ""I had been looking forward to this film. It starred off fine, Almut collected eggs, put them in a bowl and as she began to whisk them she must also have whisked up the edit because the film is just a series of disconnected vignettes, flitting back and forth.\n\nDue to the non-linear format of the film it was difficult to connect with or care about either of the leads or their story.\n\nThe Producer and the Director took the wrong decision to make the film in this way.\n\nThe only things about this film I actually cared about were, how did their daughter take the news of her mothers illness. What happened to Tobias' car once the traffic jam ended. And finally, how did Tobias & the daughter get home from school the day Almut forgot them.\n\nMy advice to the film makers is, before the UK release, they take the film and re-edit it for a more sequential film, sure, have a flashback occasionally but not the whole film.\n\nI have given the 5 stars for all the performers in the film, they did their bit, not knowing the film will be a disjointed mess.

Well, it's alright, if you enjoy the cinematic equivalent of beige wallpaper. The narration? Textbook stuff, really.

It's all perfectly polished, perfectly staged, perfectly... fake. The scenes are flatter than a pancake on a Sunday brunch.\n\nNow, let's talk Garfield. Bless him, he's trying his hardest.

It'll have you sobbing.\n\nIt's so different seeing Andrew take on a role like this so I was kinda surprised seeing him in this dark yet honest and raw headspace.

Andrew Garfield plays the most boring, softly spoken husband you can imagine. I guess the idea was to convey deep emotion, but he just came across as unemotional and a bit 2 dimensional.

I don't have a clue why it jumped around to the past present and future - that served absolutely zero purpose.\n\nOverall I'd say I did not feel for the characters, the movement between different times in their relationship was just a distraction and reduced the emotional impact, and what could have been a sweet story (though quite basic and predictable) ended up being somewhat monotonous. I would not recommend this film, even if you love romantic films. It's watchable on a Sunday afternoon if you're doing the ironing, but entirely forgettable."", ""It cannot be overstated how good Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield are in this film. Having already established themselves as two of the best actors working today, We Live in Time showcases their talents through emotional individual performances and palpable chemistry. Much like their characters, the pair are great individually and even better together.\n\nI also appreciate the subtle hand with which the movie was written and directed. It managed to be funny without being unserious and avoided clichés despite the overall story feeling somewhat familiar. Even during the more dramatic scenes, I never felt that the film was clamoring for awards, which is a testament to the wonderful acting as well as Nick Payne's script and John Crowley's direction.\n\nWhile there is almost nothing to complain about regarding We Live in Time, there is also very little that feels truly groundbreaking. If you go in expecting a movie with the dramatic and romantic peaks of something like The Notebook, you may walk out feeling underwhelmed. I doubt it will ever become a classic of the genre. That said, it is well made, sweet, and intentional. I constantly felt the emotions that I wanted to feel various times, although none of the emotions were ever taken to the extreme. The movie also explores compelling questions about family, personal choice, and what makes a person's life meaningful.

This tenet makes the movie honor its title very well. This is a very good movie for anyone who loves a good romance, but you will need tissues.', ""This film speaks so personally to me. Showing all of life's greatest joys & fears in gentle, optimistic, & real ways is so powerful. The chemistry of the leads is legendary. The plot structure allows for crippling emotion.\n\n. .\n\n.

Every 5 minutes there's a cut going all the way from the beginning to all the way to the ending scenes and right back to the middle. It was like watching a 2 hr long trailer. I really think had they decided to go with a proper sequence of events it would have come out decent. The overall story is pretty predictable but the story is good; just the direction and film-editing is where it all went wrong. The actors were good, shots were good, and the other elements were also decent. Hope to see Andrew in more movies where the direction is not awfully subpar."", ""We Live in Time is a pretty solid romance movie. Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh are obviously really good in their roles and John Crowley did a good job directing. I think that Nick Payne's script has a few moments that really shine. The scene where Florence Pugh reads the letter that we don't get to see, and we just have her facial reaction was a good scene. The birth scene was also a great balance of emotion and humor. There are some elements that feel a little underdeveloped. I also think there are some character choices that make Florence Pugh's character come across as a little unlikable. Overall the movie is entertaining but I would've liked a little bit more from it."", ""Soooo We Live in Time left me an emotional wreck.\n\nWe Live in Time is spectacular, it's magic, it's transcendental, and it's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. One of the most authentic and honest love stories out there. It sends you through a transcending level of emotions as it flashes through the life of one couple. The film is relatable, emotional, funny, and awkward, but sincerely real - there is a nice embrace of naturalism and ordinariness. It's easy to guess how the film will go, but it doesn't make it any less effective. This beautifully simple drama is made all the more poignant thanks to Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh's perfect performances. They are electric here. Their easy chemistry made every moment authentic and genuinely delightful. The movie is basically Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield being in love and living a life together for nearly two hours and the results are everything I could have wanted - very sweet and emotional. Much funnier than expected, the charm of the two leads (and a moving score) elevates this nonlinear modern UK love story to become something utterly heartbreaking, though some may still take issue with its meandering and basic plot as much of it can feel like watching an elongated montage. The narrative bounces around in time in a non-linear fashion, but the collage of moments drives the emotion home without ever feeling manipulative.\n\nIt might be a stopwatch, or the timer on an iPhone. It could be an egg timer in the kitchen, or the countdown at an international cooking competition, though that's less likely for most of us. We're surrounded by the constant reminder that our stay here on Earth is limited-our lives are finite. We Live in Time is a contained, yet emotionally rich tour through the joys and sorrows of reality's obstacles amidst a textured take on life, love, and everything in between. A life worth living is one full of risks. Wonderful things don't happen by waiting. This film is a truly moving romance/tearjerker - I loved it.\n\nNot to mention there is a scene in here that is probably simultaneously one of the funniest and most beautiful of the year."", 'As ""We Live In Time"" (2024 release from the UK; 108 min) opens, we are introduced to Tobias, who is having a tough time. He has divorce papers in front of him. He realizes he doesn\'t have a pen to sign, so he decides to go out to the convenience store. On his way back, he is hit hard by a car and he is hospitalized. At this time we are less than 10 minutes into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest from British director John Crowley (""Brooklyn""). Here he brings the love story of a couple. The ""twist"" is that the movie is brought in a nonlinear narrative. We literally are thrown back and forth in time, without any apparent reason or purpose. The movie is plot-heavy so the less said about that, the better. I will say this : the movie reminded me very quickly of the 1970 smash hit ""Love Story"". It\'s as if someone thought ""hey, let\'s take Love Story, update it for the 21st century, and for good measure let\'s move it from the US to Great Britain"". Thankfully the movie benefits greatly from the strong lead performances by Andrew Garfield as Tobias and, even better, Florence Pugh as Almut. I wouldn\'t be surprised at all if Pugh ends up doing nicely in the year-end awards season. There is also a nice classical score by The National\'s Bruce Dessner.\n\n""We Live In Time"" premiered at this year\'s Toronto International Film Festival to positive acclaim. The movie is currently rated 80% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which feels very generous to me. The movie was released in US theaters in mid-October. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended so-so (I counted less than 10 people). If you are in the mood for a love story in the UK that reminds of ""Love Story"", I\'d readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.', 'The performances are amazing. The story is so well written. The characters and everything was really really well done. I am a man who cries rarely, and this had me in tears by the end of the movie. Some nude scenes were definitely unnesscary. But the movie in whole does makes you learn alot of lessons. ANDREW GARFIELD has done marvelous job!!! So has FLORENCE PUGH. It is indeed worth watching. The layout of the whole movie makes it soo feelable that your body starts to react to every situation being displayed. The visuals, cinematography, DIRECTION, PRODUCTION, STYLING and everything was like how it should have been. TEAM WE LIVE IN TIME HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB.', ""There is one movie that I've been super excited to see since I saw the trailer, and every time since. I'm happy to report that what I felt watching the trailer, I felt even more during WE LIVE IN TIME, the realistic romance story. This movie focuses on the relationship between Tobias (Andrew Garfield) and Almut (Florence Pugh). It's told out of order, starting with Almut's diagnosis. I think it was smart to start the story here because it hammers home the idea that life can be fleeting, so you have to make every day count. This is in the back of your mind as you're watching these people fall in love with each other and build a life of their own. I'm a huge fan of seeing more realistic relationships on screen. Every relationship has problems, it's if you can come together to communicate and problem solve your way through them that determines if you keep at it or walk away. I can see how some people might not like how the story unfolds here, but I think it flows, like looking back at the special memories of your relationship. The best part about this movie by far is the acting performances from our two Academy Award nominees. The onscreen chemistry between them is frankly ridiculous. I believed every second of it, from Garfield's expressive face to Pugh's dialogue delivery. This movie is rated PG, but there are a few scenes where I would question that. WE LIVE IN TIME has a lot in it that could feel like it's manipulating your emotions and pulling your heartstrings, but I live for that. Being in a relationship can be trying at times, but this movie reminds us that it's more than worth it in the end."", '""We Live in Time"" is one of those films that grabs you by the heart, and even though you know you\'re being emotionally manipulated, you go along with it without a second thought. Directed by John Crowley and starring Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield, the movie blends romance, drama, and a fair share of tragedy. While the narrative might feel familiar, it stands out thanks to the intensity of the performances and the way the story is told.\n\nThe plot is structured in a non-linear way, which might be a challenge for some viewers-I personally found it a bit frustrating at times, and I\'m usually okay with this type of storytelling. We follow Tobias (Garfield) and Almut (Pugh) through four intersecting timelines: the beginning of their romance, the impact of Almut\'s cancer diagnosis, her dream of competing in a cooking competition, and the final moments of her life. This fragmented narrative has its highs and lows. On one hand, it mirrors the way memory works, especially during intense life events, but on the other, it sometimes feels too jumbled, making it harder to get fully immersed in one specific chapter of their relationship.\n\nWhat holds this structure together is the stellar acting from Pugh and Garfield. Florence Pugh delivers yet another sensitive, magnetic performance, portraying a layered Almut torn between savoring her final moments and facing the challenges of her illness. But it\'s Andrew Garfield who truly shines. He conveys an emotional depth through his eyes and subtle expressions that adds so much weight to even the simplest scenes. The chemistry between the two is undeniable, making the couple\'s joys and heartbreaks feel incredibly real. At a time when movie romances often feel over-the-top or shallow, seeing a relationship handled with such maturity is refreshing.\n\nThat said, Nick Payne\'s screenplay isn\'t without flaws. The transitions between timelines can feel forced at times, and some scenes are too brief to leave the intended impact. For instance, Almut\'s pregnancy and the birth of their child are shown in fleeting moments that, while visually striking, leave you wanting more. The film tries to tackle a lot-cancer, romance, motherhood, career-but doesn\'t dive as deeply into all these themes as it could have.\n\nVisually, the film takes a minimalist approach, which works in its favor. Crowley and his team avoid over-the-top techniques, keeping the focus on the actors and the raw emotion of the scenes. The choice not to use titles or markers to separate the timelines is bold, though it might confuse less attentive viewers. Still, this understated style fits a film that\'s ultimately about the highs and lows of a shared life. The music and production design complement the story without overpowering it. The score, though sparingly used, perfectly amplifies the most emotional moments, while the set design and costumes subtly establish the shifts in time and mood.\n\nOverall, ""We Live in Time"" doesn\'t reinvent the romantic drama genre, but it delivers a deeply emotional experience. It leans heavily on the strength of its performances rather than the complexity of its script-and that works. The film isn\'t afraid to be sentimental or to tug at your heartstrings, and for anyone willing to take this ride full of ups and downs, it\'s a rewarding watch. Sure, some might feel like they\'ve seen this story before, but with such powerful performances and an honest approach, ""We Live in Time"" manages to leave its mark. If you enjoy films that blend tears and hope, grab some tissues-you\'ll need them.', ""Once in a while, we get a film that pushes all the right buttons. No speical effects, no huge promotional pushes, simply dependent on word of mouth. We Live In Time is one of those films. Director John Crowley has gifted us with a film that makes you feel as if you're eavesdropping on a couple's private conversations, their thoughts, their struggles. And you identify with them, slipping into their lives as they try to make their relationship work, fail, come together and face excruciating challenges, challenges that happen to many of us.\n\nAlmut (Florence Pugh) and Tobias (Andrew Garfield) are brought together in a violent, but luckily not fatal, automobile mishap. Tobias, walking the streets at night in his bathrobe, steps off the curb straight into the path of an oncoming vehicle, driven by Almut. It's definitely meet-cute at first sight, right after Tobias wakes up in the hospital from his near fatal collision.\n\nWhat I found exemplary about We Live In Time is the delicate touch writer Nick Payne and editor Justine Wright had with the film. It's not told in a straightforward manner, by which I mean the scenes are not sequential; they unspool two steps forward, one step back. But due to deft handling, we're never confused about where we are in the lives of the couple. You know from the onset that there will not be a happy ending. Yet the happiness that imbues the film, and the lives of the couple, as they discover each others strengths and weaknesses, how they create one out of two and yet still keep something of themselves, is the crux of the movie.\n\nAlmut is a Master Chef, with a wall full of international accolades. She is quite the free spirit and is positive she has no intentions of going the route of wife/mother. She has plans, lots of plans. Tobias is in advertising, recently split from his wife, and feels most comfortable when things are stable and predictable. He's extremely guarded in his emotions. So, of course, the sparks fly between the two. Almut even nicknames Tobias the 'Weetabix Man' to her friends, who see the couple's growing connection and try to help it along.\n\nWe are given snippets of their life - meeting their friends, their families, their co-workers. Seeing the possibilities. Learning about each others pasts and the scars that have made them who they currently are. Boy meets girl, boy screws up and loses girl, yes, we've seen it before. Expectations spoken, hearts broken. Yet the third act sneaks up on you so delicately that you remain immersed in the story. At times I felt like I was intruding.\n\nThe birth of their child is one of the most amusing sequences I've seen this year. No, I'm not even going to hint at the location.\n\nYes, it's about the power of love, but also about acceptance. Learning that pushing someone to conform to your idea of happiness and normalcy may please you initially, but probably not for the long term. Especially when you learn that the time you have with them has an expiration date. How do you love exponentially, how do you dream of a future, when you know your time is running out? How do you continue to be truthful and present with yourself, your partner, your loved ones, when the clock is ticking?\n\nIt may sound maudlin and sappy, but it's not. It's soft and warm, filled with heartbreak and challenges, reminiscent of that McGraw-O'Neal classic, Love Story, but not as teary. Let We Live In Time sneak up on you. You won't be disappointed."", ""I'm not too big in romance movies as a whole but I have to say this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Very emotional, extremely deep and thoughtful, and no wasted time. I love the idea of having multiple timelines going simultaneously. This was such a well done movie. Incredible cast. Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh were amazing together on screen. In my opinion the greatest strength of the movie is that it doesn't feel like one moment is wasted. Generally with romance movies specifically, it seems there is a lot of fluff. This movie has no filler and is so genuinely emotional. Highly recommended from someone who doesn't particularly care for romance movies as a whole."", 'We Live in Time is a heartfelt, beautifully woven love story that pulls at all emotions. I was captivated by the chemistry between Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield as their story unfolded with all the tenderness, hope, and heartbreak that love can bring-especially when life throws unexpected challenges. The film doesn\'t shy away from the rawness of facing a health scare, balancing romance with a somber reality that makes the ending hit even harder.\n\nAnd trust me, you\'ll want to have those tissues close by! Florence Pugh was mesmerizing, even as her character made choices that made me wonder, ""Girl, what are you doing?"" But, hey, love risn\'t always logical, right? I\'d give it a solid 3.5 out of 5 (or 7 out of 10). It\'s a bittersweet, romantic watch that\'s perfect for a date night-just be ready for a few tears along the way.', '""We Live in Time"" (2024) is a tender and poignant film that explores the complexities of love, loss, and the preciousness of time. While the narrative may tread familiar territory, the film\'s exceptional performances and heartfelt exploration of human connection elevate it to a truly moving and memorable experience.\n\nFlorence Pugh and Andrew Garfield deliver powerhouse performances as a couple navigating the challenges of a life-altering diagnosis. Their chemistry is undeniable, capturing the intimacy and tenderness of their relationship with remarkable authenticity. Pugh\'s portrayal of a woman grappling with mortality is both heartbreaking and inspiring, while Garfield\'s performance as her devoted partner is equally affecting.\n\nThe film\'s non-linear structure, jumping between different stages of their relationship, adds a layer of complexity and intrigue to the narrative. This unconventional approach highlights the unpredictable nature of life and the importance of cherishing every moment.\n\nWhile the film\'s plot may not be groundbreaking, its exploration of love, loss, and the human condition is both profound and universal. The film\'s emotional impact is further enhanced by its stunning cinematography and a moving score that perfectly complements the narrative\'s emotional beats.\n\nOverall, ""We Live in Time"" is a beautifully crafted and emotionally resonant film that celebrates the power of love and the resilience of the human spirit. Its exceptional performances, poignant storytelling, and stunning visuals make it a must-watch for those seeking a heartfelt and thought-provoking cinematic experience.', '""We Live in Time"" is one touching and moving film as after you watch you feel the emotions and joy it\'s like you\'ve been touched as most of us can relate to most of the movies themes of love, chance, romance, change, and tragedy. Set in England the story involves an up and coming colored bra wearing chef named Almut(Florence Pugh) who by chance and accident meets a recent divorced man Tobias(Andrew Garfield). And the two grow together and they fall in love and the passion is hot and steamy(some of the love and nude scenes of Florence are sexy). Then comes a child and both grow as a couple with Almut giving birth. Most of the film is told thru flashback as it tells how the past shaped the couples current state. However with love, family, and life it has it\'s ups and downs as after Almut receives some bad health news time becomes more precious as it\'s like each minute and moment is cherished. Many can take this as live life in the minute and to the fullest. Overall this is a very good film of connection and romance with love and passion, it proves that life is about chance yet memories last forever. Really this is one film to see.', 'I\'m still trying to wrap my head around the movie. It\'s got Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield with their insane chemistry! They play this couple, Almut and Tobias, and you totally believe in their connection from the moment they meet.\n\nBut here\'s the thing: the movie jumps around in time like crazy! One minute they\'re falling head over heels, the next they\'re dealing with the ups and downs of a long-term relationship, and then BAM, we\'re back to their first date. It\'s supposed to be this deep dive into how time and memory work, but honestly, it left me feeling a bit lost.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, Pugh and Garfield are phenomenal. They\'re the reason I stayed glued to the screen. You feel every emotion, every unspoken word, every little shift in their relationship. And visually, the movie is stunning. There are some seriously beautiful scenes.\n\nBut that timeline, though! It was like trying to follow a conversation where everyone\'s talking over each other. I get that they were going for something unique, but it made it hard to really get invested in the story. And sometimes, it felt like they were trying a little too hard to be profound, you know? Like, ""time is fleeting, love is eternal,"" we get it!\n\nOverall, I\'m on the fence. There are parts I loved, especially the performances, but the confusing timeline and the sometimes heavy-handed message kept me from fully connecting with it.', '""This film portrayed a dysfunctional relationship, led by a deeply-in-love, quirky Andrew Garfield. Both actors were great, don\'t get me wrong! But I felt that Florence either intended to play a constrained, controlling character who never truly revealed vulnerability, or she simply missed the mark entirely-which was disappointing. Garfield, on the other hand, was exceptional; I could feel the emotion in his eyes, and it was clear he was far more in love with her than she was with him.\n\nIt was frustrating, too, because the movie was marketed as an intensely emotional film with standout performances, but in the end, it felt like just another Hallmark movie-one I wouldn\'t choose to watch again.\n\nI can recognize, however, the film\'s intent in capturing the essence of a \'solid\' relationship by portraying only key moments-much like looking back on a past relationship in real life. In hindsight, it feels like you blink, and suddenly, you\'re back at that family dinner, that unforgettable first night together, or the moment you welcomed your first child. The passage of time feels so fast, heartbreakingly brief, and, in the case of an abusive relationship, profoundly unfulfilling.\n\nSorry but Florence lacked heart and emotion. Kudos to Andrew, he carried the whole movie in its back.', ""If there was ever a movie that could tell a story of a couple very much in love and having ups and down of everyday life, that film is We Live in Time.\n\nI really like the way the movie jumps around, back and forth through timelines. Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh really sell their love story. The movie itself shows their romance in a realistic way. And Garfield and Pugh give Oscar worthy performances. Sometimes it's not always easy to sit through, and the characters can be flawed and unlikable sometimes, but honest and human. It's basically a celebration of life and love, and sometimes we see ourselves in them."", ""Its a true to life story thats focuses on love, reality and legacy. The movie is quite fraustating at times but blends everything into a touching story by the end.\n\nThe story and script are realistic and straight forward. The actors portrayed the charecters well and left a heartfelt sensation by the end of the movie. The movie showcases the charms of mundane life we take for granted. The story is a little different from the mainstream movies but its a simple one. I think the directors attempt to bring more excitement to the movie by using multiple non-linear, random time jumps failed spectacularly. Due to the multiple time jumps the first half of the movie was extremely fraustating. Those who left the movie mid scene might even give a scrore between 2 - 4 out of 10. But the emotions and struggles the loving couple faces while longing for a legacy to leave behind and accepting reality is quite heart warming. I would have scored it 7.5 if it weren't for the multiple extremely fraustating time jumps.\n\nIn conclusion, Unique and touching story brought alive and elevated by the actors but brought down by the time jumps."", 'That\'s what the movie is really about. The story goes on to be on of the most pure and sincere representation of love written on a screenplay.\n\nStill, there are obviously some romantic cliches on the movie. But these cliches are mostly about the outcome of the actions and the attitudes of the characters, which is completely comprehensive on a fixed plot, since the story goes on to be a great and kind example of a ""perfect relationship"".\n\nWe all know, generally, in these type of movies, there are certainly many plot holes, and some inconsistencies in the story.\n\nStill, this does not change the fact, that the intentions of the movie are pure and genuine. And this is the main message and objective of the movie. At the end of the day, love will prevail in all situations, even on difficult times.\n\nAlso, both actors were completely involved and ""raw"" in every single interaction. Which nowadays, is not so easy to see, especially in romantic roles.', ""Tobias and Almut's relationship has changed and grown from their first accidental encounter to overcoming their differences and facing life head-on. They must face a hardship that tests their resolve and what they want from their relationship and life.\n\nThis film shows how individuals and love evolve over time and circumstance. The story is beautifully told throughout the couple's relationship, jumping from their courtship to cohabiting, starting a family, and struggling with life's hardships. There is some comedy, drama, and a lot of emotion throughout the film. The film is one hour and forty-eight minutes long, and the way the story is told makes it feel short. This is an excellent watch for a night out on the town or to stay home and stream; either way, it is worth a watch."", ""Yet another cancer-mance that misses the mark.\n\nFor what is essentially an hour and fifty minute character study of two individuals, Garfield's role is woefully underwritten leaving him little work with other than a permanent day-old stubble look, and the wondrous patience and understanding of a boyfriend who is also (somehow) a divorcee. As a result, his Tobias is merely a two-dimensional foil for Pugh's Almut.\n\nPugh shines here in a wonderfully understated role that she does much to bring to life. Despite the sometimes sweet, sometimes clunky writing, she's invested in bringing the unlikely named Almut to life -- someone who has made so much of her life, and has so much more to lose.\n\nUnfortunately, the script doesn't have the same level of commitment, and actually forgoes voicing the sentiment that makes up her mind to tackle the cancer treatment once more.\n\nUltimately, all of this is much better done in a far more entertaining way in 2017's The Big Sick. See it if you're a Pugh fan, but if you give it a pass, you won't be missing much."", 'Andrew Garfield, in an interview, confessed to having shared lodgings with the likes of Robert Pattinson and Eddie Redmayne ere fame found him... Andrew Garfield is a unique and humble talent who hath risen amidst such formidable rivals... In truth, Andrew Garfield is, to my mind, the finest and greatest actor of our generation (those born in the 1980s).\n\nJohn Crowley, though much beloved by myself, faced criticism after The Goldfinch (2019), a film misunderstood by many. He remained silent for a time, then returned to his roots and collaborated once more with Andrew Garfield, with whom he had found great accord in the film Boy A (2007)... Indeed, Garfield\'s contribution to the script, penned by Nick Payne, cannot be denied... Garfield is not merely a master of crafting characters, but also possesses the ability to convey those characters to the audience, a skill he hath likely honed through his theatrical background. He and Florence Pugh have found a marvelous harmony together.\n\n""\'We live in time\' tells the tale of a promising chef and a newly divorced man whose lives are changed by a chance encounter."" Aye, such is the film\'s presentation, as hath been written in all the media. But is the meeting of the two in the film so simple as to be called chance? Or might we say, ""There are no coincidences in coincidence""?\n\nTo tell the audience that the story will end in death, and then to narrate it in such a naive fashion, and yet, despite never resorting to sentimentality, to leave the audience with a sense of melancholy at the film\'s end, is a testament to Crowley\'s skill as a storyteller.\n\nCancer... Divorce... Poor career choices that lead to crisis...\n\nGreat matters... pertaining to life...\n\nSig Parvis Magna\n\nThe logic of cracking an egg with two bowls, the desire to master risotto when one has the ability to dance with a knife on ice... Small matters...\n\nCan hundreds of small but beautiful things influence the negative repercussions of one great evil thing?\n\nCrowley makes another wise choice and presents the story to us not with linear transitions, but with a narrative that salutes life, and in doing so, he completes his tale with the cinematography of Stuart Bentley, who, having made his presence known in many mid-scale projects, finally has the chance to show himself, and Justine Wright, who also edited Locke (2013), a film that broke ground with its narrative.\n\nA24, while for some time now appearing to be a company that raises question marks in people\'s minds, hath managed to say ""I am still here"" with ""We Live in Time"".', '""We Live In Time"" follows the story of Almut (Florence Pugh) and Tobias (Andrew Garfield), who are brought together by a surprise encounter that changes their lives. Through snapshots of their life together -- falling for each other, building a home, becoming a family -- a difficult truth is revealed that rocks its foundation. As they embark on a path challenged by the limits of time, they learn to cherish each moment of the unconventional route their love story has taken. Directed by John Crowley, ""We Live In Time"" is a film that explores the complexity of time and grief.\n\nFlorence Pugh and Andrew Garfield delivered a raw and poignant performance, but the latter truly stands out with his subtle yet powerful expressions. Andrew\'s ability to convey his emotions and grief through his eyes and subtle gestures is a testament to the actor\'s range, drawing the audience into the depths of his character\'s emotional journey. You can tell how much Andrew took his character to a personal level as he has been very open about his perspective of grief, which transcends on the big screen.\n\nWhile the film deals with some heavy themes, such as grief and loss, it is predictable and can feel all over the place due to its non-linear storytelling structure. However, what holds the film together is the palpable chemistry between Pugh and Garfield. Their genuine and heartfelt interactions make their on-screen relationship feel authentic and relatable. This connection and honest narrative carry the film, allowing viewers to become more invested in their love story even when the plot sometimes stumbles upon a rough path.\n\nAs mentioned, the film\'s unorthodox approach to storytelling is unique. Instead of following a more traditional and structured way of telling, the film invites the audience to explore grief at different stages of each character\'s life. While this approach may not appeal to everyone, particularly those who prefer a more one-line narrative, for those open to this approach, this style allows for a richer exploration of grief. In these moments of raw and honest storytelling, the film truly shines, offering a more poignant look at how people deal with loss, grief, and the passage of time.\n\nContrary to most romance-drama films, which aim to make audiences cry, ""We Live In Time"" takes a different route. The film does not seek to manipulate the emotions of the audience with dramatic scenes or tear-jerking moments. Instead, the film gently guides the audiences to reflect on the nature of loss and grief, encouraging us to see time as a friend rather than a foe. The film\'s honest and optimistic narrative urges us to make the most of our time, no matter how little it may be. It\'s a very refreshing approach to a relatively common subgenre of drama, anchored by the outstanding performances of its leads, great cinematography, and a promising direction.\n\nDespite its strengths, the film has its challenges. The pacing can be uneven, and some plot points feel underdeveloped or rushed. There are moments when the film\'s ambition seems to exceed its reach, leaving certain themes unexplored, such as motherhood. Yet, these missteps don\'t overshadow the film\'s core message or emotional impact. ""We Live In Time"" is a perfect film to confront your emotions and will take you on a journey filled with emotional punches.\n\nThe film doesn\'t just tell a story; it invites audiences to experience a range of emotions, from heartbreak to hope, alongside its characters. This emotional journey is what makes ""We Live In Time"" a standout, lingering in the minds of viewers. The direction, though unconventional, allows for moments of introspection and connection. It challenges viewers to think about their own relationship with time and how they process grief. It\'s a testament to the power of storytelling, showing that even in its predictability, a film can touch hearts and provoke thought.\n\nIn conclusion, ""We Live In Time"" is a film that, despite its flaws, offers a poignant exploration of time, grief, and human connection. It\'s a journey that invites viewers to reflect on their take on grief and the passage of time. While it may not be perfect, its emotional depth and the exceptional performances of its leads make it a standout film worth watching. Whether you\'re drawn in by the story, the performances, or the themes, ""We Live In Time"" will leave a lasting impression, reminding us of the precious nature of time and the importance of making the most of it.']",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/todo-tempo-que-temos/3263a19b-386a-41bf-88b6-7349348344f7.webp

It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn\'t shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom\'s relationship has never felt more genuine. I\'ll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.\n\nSome may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.\n\nNow, don\'t get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it\'s self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.\n\nEven with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy\'s existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I\'d rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn\'t.', '""Venom: The Last Dance\' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.\n\nIs it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.\n\nThe duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I\'m sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).\n\nThe humor is there, but can\'t say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.\n\nKnull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they\'ll use him again...it\'s Sony after all.\n\nIt\'s a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000\'s comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It\'s just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.\n\nThere are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.', ""It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.\n\nIn terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.\n\nHowever, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.\n\nOverall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway."", ""A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.\n\n'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!\n\nTom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters."", ""Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.\n\nCGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.\n\nThere were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring."", ""First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.\n\nWith Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.\n\nOf course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.\n\nWhile the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.\n\nIf the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.\n\nI feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me."", ""If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it."", ""This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.\n\nI enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.\n\nThe middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'\n\nAs a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint."", ""Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.\n\nDon't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable."", ""Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained.

Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance."", ""Such a waste movie. Movie is just 1 hour 33 minutes in length and one hour of the movie is total waste. Remaining is fight scenes but fight scenes are so bad and camera is so shaky. You will never understand what's going on. Movie is boring. Such a waste of a movie. The entire experience left me feeling utterly disappointed and, honestly, a bit frustrated. The movie is just 1 hour and 33 minutes in length, yet it somehow manages to waste the majority of that time. For the first hour, the plot drags along with almost no engaging moments or any real storyline development. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to stretch out a very thin plot, and as a result, most of the scenes seemed irrelevant or repetitive."", 'Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!\n\nThis trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony\'s Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.\n\nI should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed\'s Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson\'s enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris\' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""\n\nLet\'s get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.\n\nDespite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).\n\nThe rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.\n\nThe visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.\n\nThe action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.\n\nThe Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.\n\nI think that is it for the positives.\n\nI felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.\n\nThe film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.\n\nSpeaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull\'s alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.\n\nThey also wasted Stephen Graham\'s Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.\n\nFurthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.\n\nOn top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.\n\nThe other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.\n\nTechnically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.\n\nFor the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.', 'My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom\'s home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.\n\nDirected by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).\n\nI absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom\'s signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you\'re left wanting more. The villain\'s defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.\n\nIn conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn\'t quite reach its full potential. I\'d rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.', ""Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.\n\nTom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.\n\nAs aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.\n\nIn conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences."", ""Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.\n\nI am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?\n\nI have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.\n\nIt helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.\n\nAlso, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.\n\nThe humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.\n\nThe action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.\n\nThe cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.\n\nAll that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.\n\nThe supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.\n\nThe tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.\n\nThe musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.\n\nVenom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.\n\nStay through all of the credits."", ""Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.\n\nThis film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.\n\nWhile some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.\n\nBut the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days."", 'Who came up with the idea for this movie? A kindergartener with a blue crayon scribbling on his mom\'s car walls could come up with something less formulaic and boring. Ignore the people saying it\'s one of those ""turn off your brain and have fun"" movies are lying. I love those movies, but this is not one of them. I just wish they made SOMETHING worth my time, the entire thing was just sub par, but I have never seen a movie before that literally hasn\'t made me feel nothing through out the whole thing. Not one laugh, not one smile, just a boring, boring movie, with an empty plot, and nothing of interest to make it stand out. Venom lovers are really trying to cope on this one, trying to find one good thing about it, and they have to lie most of the time, doesn\'t that say something?', ""Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.\n\nThe road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.\n\nMs Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.\n\nA lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.\n\nThe issues\n\nThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.\n\nAnother problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.\n\nThe biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions.

Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.\n\nIssue / or average\n\nThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !\n\nI give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !"", ""I did not expect this to be a movie made for us veddie shippers but I also didn't expect this. No character development, still the reluctant buddy comedy and that gets so boring when you think about the comics where their bond is so deep. I felt like that was where the first movie would lead but the second one should have prepared me for this but even the second one was still more fun and Eddie and Venom's relationship was still developing. In this it's just stopped. But I loved venom-horse!! So yeah. Everything good was in the trailer, the rest is just boring bad guys setting up for another movie."", 'If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy\'s final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it\'s an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.\n\nThe premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It\'s like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.\n\nThe so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience\'s emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.\n\nEddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.\n\nThe supporting characters are even worse-if that\'s possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.\n\nThey serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.\n\nIt wouldn\'t be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.\n\nThe final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It\'s not exciting, it\'s not entertaining, it\'s just ugly.\n\nAt its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom\'s bond, but it doesn\'t even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film\'s clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.\n\nAvoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.\n\nTom\'s ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.\n\nTom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it\'s comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?\n\nIt\'s the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.\n\nEven the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.\n\nIf you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.', ""Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future."", ""Venom: The Last Dance brings an end to the symbiote saga in a way that feels fitting but not revolutionary. Tom Hardy once again shines as Eddie Brock, bringing both humor and heart to his turbulent relationship with Venom. Juno Temple adds a new dynamic, while Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance as a new antagonist brings intensity, giving Hardy a formidable final sparring partner. While the film delivers on action, humor, and the chaotic energy fans expect, it doesn't push any new boundaries. Marcel does a commendable job balancing character moments with big, cinematic set pieces, creating a solid farewell to this iteration of Venom. However, the story plays it safe, and as enjoyable as it is, it leaves you wishing for a little more risk-taking or depth to make it truly stand out. For fans of the Venom series, it's a satisfying conclusion. It's a good final chapter-maybe not one for the ages, but certainly one worth seeing."", 'I don\'t know where to start, but I just watched the new ""Venom"". What can I say? The cast was amazing, they are truly great. I can\'t help but highlight the graphics and special effects: the film is full of beautiful locations, dynamic action scenes and spectacular destruction. There is also a lot of humor, which brings lightness to the film. However, I was disappointed with the design of the other symbiotes and aliens - it seems open and I would have liked to see something fresher and more modern.\n\nBut the main problem was the plot. I will not go into spoilers, but there is a serious inconsistency in the ending, which spoils the overall impression. Perhaps I just did not understand something. Overall, the film leaves a good impression, and I strongly recommend you to see it in the cinema, at least for the effects and visual design.\n\nI give it 7 out of 10.', '\'Venom: The Last Dance\', or Venom 3, is potentially the final film in the Venom series - but I wouldn\'t be surprised if they finally get him in the MCU with Spider-Man one day. This is a pretty good finale and fits with the tone of the first film, with some action, some violence and some solid jokes. Eddie/Venom (Hardy) is on the run in Mexico, but now being hunted by a weird giant-scorpion-alien (""xennophage"") from his home world, as well as running from the Army - Dr Paine (Temple, odd hearing her trying to do an American accent!) & General Strickland (Ejiofor, not the same as his character from Dr Strange).\n\nThe little side-plot with Martin (Ifans, also different to his Dr Connors character) and his family is nice. Not much of the plot is that important, other than it sets up the final battle and the required sacrifice. Nice that they got Mrs Chen in for a cameo, to give Venom a literal last dance. Hardy is good again, with his stiff-legged walk due to Venom being merged with him.\n\nWhile this doesn\'t have the felling of seriousness or importance that some MCU films does, for one of the Sony films, it\'s pretty fun and enjoyable. There were quite a few chuckles from me, and the CGI and action are well done. It\'s all over in ~100min and has a satisfying conclusion. Not sure if he\'ll be back, but always happy to see more of Hardy as Venom.', ""Some people are unable to watch scifi or superhero movies due to the fact that those things can not exist.\n\nI think that those genre can also produce emotions. So, I've gave 10/10 for the emotions that this movie raise in me.\n\nThe music, perfect! Yes, could look childish sometime, but what a heck!

It made me laugh a couple of times, and it had the entire theater laughing at some points, so the humor was there.\n\nThe CGI was good, and Tom Hardy, as always, delivered a committed performance as Eddie Brock and Venom. There are moments where Eddie\'s internal struggle with Venom adds some genuine tension and dark humor to the film.\n\nThe movie was chaotic like the other Venom movies, but the pacing actually felt okay in this one. The third act had some good action scenes, and the ending left me questioning and a bit frustrated, as it gave me the vibes of ""It\'s the ending because we announced it\'s the last movie, but IT\'S THE ENDING TILL FURTHER NOTICE,"" which is predictable from Marvel and Sony.\n\nOverall, Venom: The Last Dance is an OKAY popcorny movie.

Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed."", ""The trailer already gave away the main topic of the movie: Evil villains hunt our heroes Eddy and Venom.

Friends help our heroes to survive, partially by risking their own lives.\n\nBut our friends are helping the villains and risking the universe by saving Eddy...\n\nI was waiting for the solution or explanation of that problem but got disappointed. Only reason they help Eddy is because he is the main cast and the main cast has to live, no matter what, even risking the universe. Why over exaggerate with the stakes (not 1 life, not 5, not a city, country... but the whole universe), when a single person is more important anyway?\n\nI don't expect a GoT level story from Marvel films but this was just pointless.\n\nIt's the first time I regretted 3D.

This was some of the most boring, doll, cinematically disappointing hours I've witnessed. Nothing seemed to work, from the music, the character building and relationship between Eddie and Venom. This is the definition of a quick cash grab, with no heart in it what so ever. Don't forget the absolutely cringe, and not fitting music and dialogue. I don't understand this way of making superhero movies now a days, the priority is not to make a wicked awesome movie any longer, it's just to make sure there is enough cringe not funny jokes thrown in. In my opinion it's hard for me to wrap my head around that Tom Hardy has delivered the role Bane, when I see something like this.\n\nSkip this one guys, and save your money and hours!"", 'What exactly are people expecting these days?

Didn\'t really care about the antagonists at all, they were very one-dimensional and dull. Surprisingly, especially with it being PG-13, the second Venom remains my favorite. It\'s fun, and despite not being R, gets away with quite a bit. This one did, too. I mean the bad aliens literally eat people and spew their bloody remains through gill-like apertures in their backs. It\'s pretty gnarly. There\'s also two F-bombs, and yet it\'s PG-13. I\'ll take it!\n\nThe humor was mostly pretty funny, unlike the bulk of cringe jokes in most Marvel movies. I for one am a big fan of good creature design and monsters in general, in movies, which was one reason why I wanted to see this in theaters. The xenophages look awesome and the CGI was great. It\'s only during the final climax when several symbiotes are brawling with multiple xenophages that the action becomes a bit of a messy blur, but unfortunately that\'s unavoidable with these types of ""characters,"" and was the biggest letdown for me during the climax of the first Venom. Fortunately, the best action sequences occur throughout the movie than the end.\n\nMy ratings system for movies is usually based on enjoyability, but this varies. For example I gave Beasts of No Nation a 9, and this an 8. It doesn\'t mean the movies are comparable in quality; I also won\'t see BoNN once or twice a year, because it\'s such a dramatic heavy-hitter.

Something I wish the movie elevation would have done instead of the cheesy robots they had. I'll be honest, this movie left me with more than a few questions. I had to look things up and I still don't think i understand fully. This is one most people will have to look up if they full want to understand the full story.

While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.\n\nThe film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.\n\nThe real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.\n\nThe film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.\n\nThe script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.\n\nUltimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note."", 'Normally I find Marvel films too long because almost 1/3 of the movie is filled with action.

The animations were also very good in IMAX 3D with laserview and the Dolby atmos sound was sounding so real! It made you really feel like your in the movie itself. Sad that this was probably the last part of Venom. Its one of the only Marvel movies I liked. But I hope Marvel and Colombian pictures will come with something brand new for us soon! :)', ""Venom: The Last Dance is comfortably the weakest of the trilogy thanks to its nonsensical plot and a villain who's a complete non entity. However, by dialling up the goofiness and honing in on the central bond it can still be brainless entertainment, massively helped by an ending that actually commits to a genuine sense of finality. It makes the final moments unexpectedly emotional with some actual weight which is a godsend in a genre that never ends.\n\nTom Hardy is pretty much carrying this as usual. His bond with his symbiotic self has never been better as they're at a place in their relationship where they have no issues being vulnerable with each other and the constant bickering that gives this film its best jokes remains intact. It's essentially acts as a fun road trip movie for a large portion which only works because of him and the ending also relies solely on him.\n\nIt's impressive how many actors are given thankless roles here. Juno Temple and Chiwetel Ejiofor are given very one note characters and Stephen Graham has never been given a more thankless role that's just a colossal waste of his talents. There was absolutely zero point in bringing him back. Rhys Ifans on the other hand, plays to his strengths thanks to an easygoing hippie character allowing him to have a lot of fun.\n\nIts never a good idea to start your directorial career with a $120 million comic book movie so the fact that Kelly Marcel's direction is able to make any of this coherent is a miracle. Plus, she does create a couple of challenging set pieces underwater and involving animals. Dan Deacon's score is utterly generic, compensated for by a larger selection of songs than previous entries had, including an oddly fitting Maroon 5 song for the end."", ""Comment: This is a biased review.

I can take it or leave it with the big bad alien villain. I would actually prefer to have only one symbiote creature and leave out the big bad. That would concentrate the conflict. I like the family for their comedic breaks. Along with Tom Hardy, they take a derivative comic book movie and make it watchable."", 'Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) keeps losing things. Though it might be his life, most often it\'s his shoes. He starts off the movie in a pair of crocs, which, after an opening fight scene, are replaced by a dead gangmembers\' cowboy boots, followed by a pair of black leather dress shoes when he hits Vegas, baby. What he doesn\'t lose is Venom, the outspoken, chocolate-loving, human-devouring toothy symbiote attached to Eddie through two previous films, making him do all kinds of things, legal and sometimes illegal. And now we have the final installment - Venom: The Last Dance.\n\nAnd what a dance it is. Though previous scripts have danced around exactly why Venom is here on Earth, is it for good, for evil or are we merely his playthings, The Last Dance breaks it all down for us.\n\nApparently, Knull, the God of the Void, creator of all the symbiotes, is currently imprisoned on the planet Klyntar. Once he is awakened, he devises a plan to get his evil henchmen to find the Codex which will release him from his prison. The Codex happens to be on Earth, currently ensconced in, of course, the heart of Venom. Yes, I admit I had to Google most of that because though Venom does eventually tell us the whole fantastical tale over the course of the almost 2-hour film, it might get a little confusing to people like me, who aren\'t exceedingly familar with Venom\'s origin story.\n\nThat story, as usual, flies totally off-kilter. Eddie may have killed a detective, or maybe it was Venom. He\'s now a wanted man. So Eddie goes on the lam, trying to outrun those hunting him down, which isn\'t easy when you\'re off the blocks in a pair of crocs. There are multiple CG battles in the film: between Eddie and some dog-kidnapping no-good thugs; between Eddie and the US Army, lead by Rex Strickland (Chiwetel Ejiofor) in a roiling river. And lastly, inside Area 51, between Eddie and those evil symbiotic henchmen from Klyntar, who will stop at nothing to pull the Codex out of Venom and bring it back to Knull.\n\nOf course it turns out that the detective isn\'t really dead. He\'s carrying another secret. And some of those secrets are alive and being held captive underneath Area 51. The entire aliens among us project has been decommissioned. Shut down. Lights out. Nothing to see here folks, but some captured symbiotes. The entire secret operation is under the jurisdiction of Dr. Teddy Paine (Juno Temple). She and her team have been the caretakers of the captured symbiotes for quite some time. And now the Government is shutting down the program, even though no one has discovered the symbiotes purpose.\n\nLast Dance is a jambalaya of funny bits including a crazy dance number with Venom and Mrs. Chen, the woman who enjoyed sparring with her favorite alien in previous films. Plus a cross country ride in a VW bus with Martin (Rhys Ifans) and family, determined to sing the life out of Bowie\'s ""Major Tom/Space Oddity"", ad nauseum. The family, and especially Martin, are true believers that there IS life out there, though Eddie keeps telling them that they\'re mistaken. The action all comes to a head at Area 51.\n\nGotta say, I did NOT recognize Andy Serkis, but isn\'t that usually the point of casting him? Lots of fun CG work put on the big screen. And it does tie up the whole Venom as antihero buddy-movie bit in a neat little package. Or does it??? As usual, stay through the credits, so you\'ll know what I know.', '""Venom: The Last Dance"" sadly stumbles as the final chapter in the Venom trilogy, failing to deliver a satisfying conclusion to Eddie Brock and Venom\'s story. While the film offers glimpses of the quirky dynamic between the symbiote and its host, it ultimately falls short in terms of originality and excitement.\n\nTom Hardy\'s performance as Eddie Brock remains a highlight, capturing the internal struggle and chaotic partnership with Venom. However, the narrative feels uninspired, retreading familiar ground without offering anything particularly new or engaging. The action sequences, while visually decent, lack the intensity and creativity needed to elevate the film.\n\nThe plot feels convoluted and lacks a clear sense of direction, leaving the audience feeling somewhat disconnected from the stakes. The supporting characters are underdeveloped and fail to make a lasting impression.\n\nOverall, ""Venom: The Last Dance"" is a forgettable entry in the superhero genre. It lacks the spark and originality of its predecessors, leaving fans with a sense of disappointment. While Tom Hardy\'s performance is commendable, it\'s not enough to salvage a film that feels like a missed opportunity.', 'From start to finish, Venom The Last Dance, disappointed in every way possible.\n\nBoth Venom and Eddie had no character development within the movie to signify their growth both as partners and individuals.\n\nEddie seems to be in a constant depressive episode throughout the whole movie that does not go well with Venoms upbeat attitude.\n\nIn general, The Last Dance started with no evident point to where the storyline was headed. A few random scenes were added for comedic effect, which were poorly done. The only exciting parts were a few of the action scenes. However, even then the stars of those parts were not Eddie or Venom but rather the new symbiotes characters.\n\nIn conclusion, there were concepts of a plot.', 'Venom was a villain mostly remembered from the iconic ""Spider-Man 3"" with Tobey Maguire. Back then, it was played by Topher Grace and since then Venom faded a bit among general audiences, until he was revived in the rebooted franchise with Tom Hardy.\n\nThe previous two films in the series got a lot of hate and over-criticism due to unnecessary comparisons with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). While MCU films take themselves very seriously (some maybe even a bit too seriously for what they actually are), I think it\'s best to approach the Venom films with the expectation that they\'ll be what they\'re trying to be: fun, silly, and humorous action films, almost halfway to comedy, that make for an enjoyable time. Unsurprisingly, ""The Last Dance"" (brilliant title, mind you) continues this tone, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it in an IMAX theater. This isn\'t a terrible travesty like ""Madame Web"", but rather a self-parodying comic book movie that doesn\'t try to be more than it is. And it\'s just a lot of fun. In fact, it\'s funnier than many comedies I\'ve seen in recent years.\n\nWhile Dvir watched the first two films, for Or, this is the first in the series. So he provides the perspective of a new viewer. Can you enjoy the movie even if you haven\'t seen the first two? Absolutely yes. He even asked his longtime friend ChatGPT for the main plotlines of the first two films, which weren\'t really necessary while watching this one (maybe only for some background context). It seems this was anticipated, as a comic blockbuster, especially one that\'s the third in a series, needs to be accessible to as many viewers as possible. In Dvir\'s opinion, it\'s undoubtedly the best film of the trilogy.\n\nWe think the creators successfully made a mix of ""unintentional comedy"" and genuine parody of comic book films, especially of Marvel. This type of comedy may seem unintentional but is very deliberate. On the surface, it\'s an action drama, right? Comics, fun, chaos, explosions. But in truth, it\'s so perfectly self-aware that it\'s hard to ignore. They probably knew a serious film wouldn\'t be well-received and that attempting one would only anger audiences. So they created a parody of sorts, a movie that is completely aware what it is.\n\nWhat\'s enjoyable and fun is that these aren\'t typical comedy film punchlines; the humor is casual and incidental. Moments that might seem ridiculous to someone expecting a ""serious movie"" are just hilariously entertaining to those who came to have a good time. Even the existence of post-credit scenes (there are two) is a perfect parody of post-credits, done so nonchalantly.\n\nDon\'t let the generous score fool you-the movie isn\'t without flaws, and they are very present mainly in the script. Plot holes, shortcuts, strange character decisions, and other issues are present from start to finish. But again, we didn\'t come to this movie expecting high cinema; we just came for fun, and it definitely delivers on that front. And to be honest, many of these flaws actually add to the film\'s comedic side and to its character as a self-aware parody that knows exactly what it\'s trying to be.\n\nTom Hardy, a top-notch actor, delivers an amazing performance as usual, sometimes even seeming a bit too good for this type of movie. The film is based heavily on comedy and doesn\'t take itself seriously at all, and Hardy throws himself into the comedic role impressively, carrying the movie with his physical acting and voice work. The rest of the cast also does a great job, especially Rhys Ifans in a hilarious role. But ultimately, Hardy is the star and shines as always, completely stealing the show (twice).\n\nWe were surprised to discover that the cinematography was done by none other than Emmy-nominated Fabian Wagner, one of the industry\'s talented cinematographers who shot key episodes of ""Game of Thrones"", ""Sherlock"", ""The Crown"", and more. He definitely did an excellent job here. The effects were great as expected, and overall, the movie delivered very fun and enjoyable action in addition to everything else.\n\n""Venom: The Last Dance"" is pure fun at the end of the day. It\'s sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, mainly because it doesn\'t take itself seriously. Don\'t go into it expecting ""Oppenheimer 2"", ""The Godfather Part. 4"", or even ""The Avengers 28"", but instead be prepared for a fun hour and a half in a cinema, with action, effects, a serviceable story, and lots of laughs. We enjoyed it. Just please don\'t come with a heavy mindset; a tipsy one might work better.\n\nBy Dvir971 & Orr971.', ""Eddie Brock and Venom's dynamic is at its strongest in this one and the stakes are so much higher. The final act is BONKERS! It's pretty gory, super entertaining, and has tons of action sequences. The story of Last Dance is a bit hard to follow right out of the gate for a casual MCU fan, but the humor, action and incredible effects carry the film to the the finish line with grace. You'll definitely know how to ride a Venom horse feels like. Andy Serkis voices Knull. Knull is as terrifying in this film as shown in the comics. Stick around for the 2 post credit scenes. What a wholesome end to this franchise. This is not one to miss."", ""The movie and stuff that happens and how it ends doesn't make any sense, We went to the cinema on the first day, and really regretted it.\n\nI mean you have to watch it to get what I mean, this is easily one of the stupidest superhero movies ever.\n\nThe protagonist of the story can easily save all humanity, all of his friends, himself, and everyone that there is just by simply walking away BUT No he has to make stupid decision after stupid desicion just to get the plot forward.\n\nEven the ending they suddenly decided to go against everything that was established during the movie just to get end the movie some how and show some cool CGI I guess.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the post-credit scene, it Was like the CGI was done by CW in the Arrowverese."", ""Saw in imax earlier today then had a nice bourbon afterwards that was delightful! I'm not sure why this movie isn't more appreciated but damn it's a fun entertaining adventure with nice humor, great vibes, and awesome action. I love all the Venom movies although first one is the best Tom Hary/Symbiote are magnificent in all 3 no matter what. Last Dance surely has some moments to complain about Im not sure it is blast of fun to me everyone behind the crew worked hard on the film so if anything appreciate some of it. The wild villain definitely has scary strength I doubt more powerful than Thanos maybe close; thoroughly enjoyable would highly recommend!"", ""Venom: The Last Dance appears to be Tom Hardy's last solo Venom movie of his 3 film trilogy. The latest film ups the ante on the humor, action, and ludicrous storyline that has so many plot holes and predictability. Still this is probably the most entertaining Venom movie of the series. Tom Hardy is having so much fun in this movie and wants the viewer to enjoy themselves as well. As lot of recent comic book movies take itself seriously this one certainly does not. One of my biggest complaints of the film is the main bad guy is a minor footnote throughout almost as if they are setting up for the Villian to reappear in another Marvel film. I applaud this movie for having a very brisk runtime at 109 minutes. I think alot ot other movies need to follow the blueprint here of shorter runtimes instead of 3 hour epics. I had a good time with Venom: The Last Dance and was able to turn my brain off during it and enjoy everything. Venom: The Last Dance gets a entertaining 7 stars out of 10."", ""What a strange movie.\n\nAt times, it shows promise, with a sense of build-up worthy of an MCU entry and a faithful comic adaptation. The beginning offers some visually compelling sci-fi scenes, it has a solid cast of people and creatures, and some good CGI throughout.\n\nHowever, the majority of the film feels completely uninspired and underwritten. Dialogue remains subpar, and the plot meanders through trivial side events like a family road trip (where Eddie reflects on his life), sneaking into Area 51, an awkward dance with 'sexy' Miss Chen, and even Venom exploring the temptations of Las Vegas gambling, among others to fill in the space. And the main threat is so bland and uninspired that it almost feels insulting. Also very frustrating, is how Tom Hardy's character often seems to just stand around, doing little to drive the action. This lack of movement becomes grating, especially since he's also shown doing a lot of fast-paced and involved scenes. It's as if two studios filmed parts of the movie separately and then patched them together, resulting in a jarring inconsistency.. or they ran out of budget at some point. Oh, and an unintentionally comedic, romance-montage flashback scene between Eddie and Venom, complete with sappy music that feels so forced and out of place, it had me laughing out loud!\n\nAmidst it all, little Dash McCloud impressed and completely overshadowed everyone else with just two seconds of acting of heartfelt and believable anguish! That was the most memorable part of the movie... which is somewhat sad. But at least isn't as awful as the Carnage entry in the trilogy.."", '""Venom: The Last Dance"" is a phenomenal movie that masterfully combines action, drama, a strong storyline, and comedic moments, making it a truly well-rounded cinematic experience. This film has renewed my appreciation for the entire trilogy, and I\'m already planning to watch the previous installments again because of how captivating this one is. It\'s rare for a movie series to consistently deliver on all fronts, but this one does just that. If you\'re a fan of films like ""Deadpool vs Wolverine,"" this is a must-watch. Seeing it in Dolby Atmos at AMC added a whole new dimension to the experience.', ""Bad Acting and bad VFX. It's like somebody just wanted to squeeze any little drop of money that could still be squeezed from this franchise. The storyline felt like an afterthought, with plot points that barely held together and characters lacking any real depth or motivation. The chemistry that once made Eddie and Venom's dynamic engaging now feels forced, as if even the actors were tired of the script they were given.\n\nThe VFX, once a highlight of the Venom films, looked surprisingly cheap, detracting from scenes that should have been intense and visually stunning. Action sequences felt repetitive, lacking the innovation needed to make a final installment stand out. Overall, the film feels like a disappointing attempt to cash in on a franchise that once showed promise but now seems to have overstayed its welcome.""]",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/venom-a-ultima-rodada/888f6031-29b2-4f69-b82f-e5485854e1a0.webp

Após anos sem contato, elas se reencontram em uma situação extrema, mas estranhamente doce.",['Drama'],0,0,"['I was curious to see what Pedro Almodóvar would do differently in his first non-Spanish-language film, built around two of the most talented actors working today. The answer, alas: it\'s disappointing. There are many ways in which ""The Room Next Door"" lacks what makes Almodóvar\'s work so distinctive - the spontaneity, the sense of improvisation, the comic timing, the fizzy ensemble work -- but this film\'s main fault, as I see it, is that it\'s just plain overwritten, something that is rare in his previous work.\n\nThe screenplay (which he is credited with writing) was adapted from a novel by Sigrid Nunez that I have not read, but it sounds like vast swatches of the dialogue were lifted verbatim from it, with much that is ponderous and stilted, slowing down and emptying the film, where Almodóvar\'s work is usually characterized by lapidary dialogues and madcap forward movement, plunging you into the characters\' world with little exposition - as a viewer, you are kind of just there, hanging on for dear life, and figuring out relationships and social context as you go, grabbing at what you can. Even in films that deal with dark subjects (""Pain and Glory"" or ""Bad Education"" come to mind), the action and its background unfold in convincing ways (even when these are actually crazy if you stop and think about them) that draw on our intuition and empathy and depend only marginally on extended expository narration.\n\nHere, it is the opposite: the characters talk and explain on and on, with a few awkward flashbacks to establish context. Little is left to our imaginations. So, while some of the usual Almodóvarian hallmarks are there, particularly in the exquisite use of saturated, cunningly coordinated color and in the tastefulness of many of the sets and costumes (here with lots of lovely still lifes of flowers and fruits), these are reduced to props - they don\'t serve to tell the story and overwhelm you into accepting the reality of his crazily artificial visual worlds in the way they do in most of his films. And the computer-generated backdrops of New York feel completely artificial and thus become meaningless. Almodóvar\'s films certainly have plots, often quite convoluted (which is part of the fun), but they don\'t feel plot-driven, even when they are. ""The Room Next Door"", on the other hand, is all about its plot, and it is the weaker for it.\n\nWith talents like Tilda Swinton and Julianne Moore (plus the estimable John Turturro) in front of the camera, there have to be, and are, some great, often very moving, moments - how could there not be, especially given the plot\'s central premise and the way it both reinforces and strains a longstanding , close friendship in its final days? But the wordiness of this screenplay undermines Swinton, in particular. Her awesome strength lies in her powerful, enigmatic presence and in her understatement. In my unscientific assay, she speaks as much dialogue here as she has done in at least the last three or four of her films (the ones I\'ve seen, that is) combined. Think of her stunning performances in another fairly recent film about the fraught relationship between two women, ""The Eternal Daughter"" (2022), in which she plays, devastatingly, both an aging mother and her middle-aged daughter. The relationship between the two is subtle, shifting, complex, rich and involving - and yet so little of that is based on explicit dialogue. Or take her terrific performance in ""Memoria"" (2021), the enigmatic masterpiece of cosmic messaging by one of the greatest of all non-verbal directors, Apichatpong Weerasethakul. These are the kinds of films in which Swinton flourishes, going all the way back to ""Orlando"" (1992). (She did make ""The Human Voice"", speaking an extended monologue by Jean Cocteau - remarkable, and showing her versatility, but not characteristic of her.) In ""The Room Next Door"", she is required to deliver page after page of stilted - downright unnatural - prose in ways that are uncomfortable to watch and that are alienating, at least for this viewer. (This is all made worse by the upper-class, educated-American accent Swinton is required to employ. It\'s impeccably observed, as you would expect from her. But, as is so often the case with actors speaking lines in accents that are not their own, you sense that a lot of the energy that should be going into the interpretation is instead being directed into making sure they get the accent right. That is definitely the case here, especially since so many of her monologues are delivered in exceedingly tight shots.)\n\nSo I speak in sadness, as someone who\'s been an unconditional admirer of Almodóvar going back to the 1980s. His films have always been based on his own very peculiar, very specific vision of a Spanish culture that may never have existed in reality, but in which he makes us want to believe. Stepping out of that into English and into such a different, and less compelling, American world appears to have been a mistake. Let\'s hope that Almodóvar, as he pursues his amazing, extended, and rich career, will quickly go back to being himself, not the unnatural, wordy, uncompelling version that we are given here. This one, I fear, was a mistake.', ""The Room Next Door is a 2024 drama film adapted from the 2020 novel What Are You Going Through, starring Julianne Moore as Ingrid, a author who receives devastating news from a friend and fellow worker she hasn't seen in years, so travelling to the hospital she meets Martha (Tilda Swinton) and everything seems to be going well until Martha asks Ingrid to aid her in committing suicide after no one else was up for the task.\n\nExcellently done, the film itself does bring a dramatic tone along with some humour sprinkled throughout and it's engaging to say the least. However, I don't think this film is for everyone as it can be a bit slow and the dialogue does take it's time to flourish out the melodramatic atmosphere which I'm very fond of to see in stories. But I think people who are interested in dialogue and good performances should definitely give this one a try.\n\nThe acting is very impressive, as 2 of the best actresses in the industry currently, do such a wonderful job and it doesn't seem like they're trying hard, that's how good it is! Also because of this the whole film becomes very interesting and I don't think modern actors now could really deliver this story justice if they were the leads, there's something about these 2 that really create a powerful connection with eachother and I really respect that. Of course, John Turturro is provided to some good use and it was very nice to see him again as Ingrid's ex\n\nThe flaw though is the start, the backstory was completely unnecessary and I really don't understand why they had to show all those scenes. I think it was trying to fill up the runtime but I found it quite random and unconnected to what most of the film was about. I didn't understand it, also the acting and dialogue from the backstory was just appalling and really could have been done better or removed as a matter of fact.\n\nOverall, very well made and decent film with mostly great performances and a stellar story to really tidy everything up. Was enjoyable and had me entertained throughout, but it won't be for everyone. Would recommend to people who are fans of the cast or just liking movies in general.\n\nGrade: A\n\nLondon Film Festival 20th October."", ""It's hardly imaginable that there has been a more stylish, more elegant and more sophisticated movie about death before this latest achievement from Pedro Almodovar.\n\nThe set design, choice of colors and costumes makes this an almost too extravagant aesthetic pleasure to watch.\n\nMy problem is that the movie never finds the depth, which should be required in dealing with such a serious and profound topic. Should one have the freedom and autonomy to decide for oneself whether it's time to put an end to your life or not?\n\nTilda Swinton and Julianne Moore do their very best in focusing on this question, characterizing a close friendship facing its very last and most complex challenge of all.\n\nBut the long dialogues felt wooden and too formulaic for my taste. I was stunned by the visual richness of the movie, but it never touched me emotionally, something I'd have expected from a great director like Almodovar."", 'Successful writer ""Ingrid"" (Julianne Moore) is signing some books when one of her friends informs her that old pal ""Martha"" (Tilda Swinton) is suffering from cancer. Upon visiting her in hospital, she discovers that things aren\'t looking so good and over the following days the two start to become closer, sharing confidences and becoming quite inter-reliant. When an experimental treatment fails to deliver, the former war reporter ""Martha"" makes quite a bold proposal to her friend that will require them to retreat to a quiet residence in Woodstock where she will take matters into her own hands. Initially quite wary of this plan, ""Ingrid"" must decide whether or not she wishes to help - with all the moral and legal ramifications that involves, and so she turns to both of these women\'s ex-boyfriend ""Damian"" (John Turturro) for advice as she wrestles with her conscience. The concept here is really quite poignant, especially in light of reinvigorated conversations here in the UK about the rights of the terminally ill to make their own choices without fear of those they leave behind being persecuted by either the law or the zealous but I can\'t say I loved the presentation or the style. Far too much of the dialogue between the two women seems more aimed at filling-in the audience rather than on building a rapport between them. Things that they would have to have known about the other are presented in all too sterile a fashion, and at times I wondered if there wasn\'t a fair degree of dubbing going on too. Indeed, the whole thing deals with some seriously emotional issues in a remarkably sterile fashion. Both actors deliver strongly, but their dynamic isn\'t convincing - well, it wasn\'t for me, and the surfeit of verbiage rather suffocated the emotional impact the film could have made. Alex Høgh Andersen sheds his Viking leathers to remind us briefly of the ghastliness of the Vietnam war but otherwise this is largely down to the two characters dealing with a scenario we all dread, just not terribly convincingly.', ""Seeing an Almodovar movie in English is a bit weird. This is such a quintessential Spanish director, that the lack of Spanish (apart from one short sentence) seems to take away an essential element from the movie. But even in English, Almodovar stays Almodovar, just like Woody Allen stayed Woody Allen in his French film.\n\nI think this is one of the best movies he has made. It's beautiful, it's touching, it's meaningful. Not many films combine those three qualities. It seems as if with every new movie he directs, he gets closer to the purest film making. In this case, it's a story about two friends who both have to come to grips with death. Martha is dying of cancer and wants euthanasia, Ingrid is an old friend who is afraid of death but nevertheless agrees to accompany Martha in her last days.\n\nThis sounds as if the film is very depressing. Let me assure you: it is not. Far from it. There are far more happy moments than sad ones. Even Martha embraces life in her last moments, because she wants to spend them in a stunningly luxurious villa in the woods.\n\nAlmodovar once again creates a world of beauty, full of colour and aesthetics. His sets are, as usual, carefully designed. But this is also a very moving film, showing how valuable good friendships can be and how, even in death, dignity and respect are essential values.\n\nAlmodovar includes many references in his film. Martha and Ingrid watch movies by Buster Keaton and John Huston, and they go to a cinema where a Rosselini movie is playing. But the most obvious influence, I think, is Ingmar Bergman. Not only is the story reminiscent of Bergman's Persona, but the whole movie has a Bergman-esque feeling. Just like many Bergman movies, it relies heavily on dialogue, tackles themes like death and religion, and has a limited number of characters. The difference: Almodovar adds some Spanish warmth and colour."", ""There are more happy moments than sad moments in this film despite its main theme being death & how we cope or don't cope with it.\n\nI haven't watched a lot of Almodovar but I was interested to see his first English film especially with Julianne Moore & Tilda Swinton in it.\n\nOther reviews say that it's nothing new from the director. Having not seen many of his films I can't confirm that. I do admire how he can take something we struggle to talk about and bring colour & happiness to it.\n\nThere seems to also be a consensus that more could've been done with the characters considering the quality of actors available to Pedro Almodovar. I don't know about that, I think less is more.\n\nEnough of the characters backstory is expressed to tell the story. Why do more?"", ""I suggested to my parents and my uncle to go watch the new Almodovar's in theaters. In Spain every time he presents a movie, is an event. So after the credits roll we were all surprised and excited (except my father, but that's normal) and we unanimously said that it has become our favourite of Almo's. What a great job in all aspects. Who would have thought that, after several missteps he would gave us one of his best movies of his career. Everything works: the script is light and deep; he talks about death and life but mostly about friendship and how valuable is. Julianne and Tilda are superb, so credible and touching, the music of Alberto Iglesias, photography, the full cast, everything works. It's a must see for anyone with a minimum of sensitivity and love for the craftwork of cinema."", ""It's really sad that this great theme and these great actors were used to make this mediocre, banal and almost demented movie.\n\nThe story is good, though I'm guessing the original book does it a better service, but the writing and directing of the dialogue is so bad I first thought it was ironic. Sadly it wasn't. The actors save what can be salvaged with really good performances, but every time they talk you find yourself waiting for them to stop. And most of the movie is dialogue.\n\nThere are beautiful shots and great lighting, and a lot of colours borrowed from Edward Hopper, to which the characters even point to not so subtly.\n\nI'm really sad this movie wasn't better."", ""It was good but not Pedro Almodovsr's best. He was walking on new territory Language wise which you could feel as the dialogue work was not among his strongest. Topic wise and style wise ( especially the coloring ) was right up his allley though. And he brought two of the absolute heavy weights of modern cinema together on screen: Tilda Swinton and Julianne Moore, that alone is a wonderful achievement. Swinton is great and gives a powerhouse performance as you would expect. Julianne Moore also delivers but often seemed to leave the stage to Swinton except for some great reactive moments and the last third. I was not a dab of the ending as there were many unanswered questions. One of the biggest issues was that Almodovar focused too much on the first third of the film with a lot of elements that were abandoned and never concluded in the end. Still absolutely worth to see for the two leads and one of the most colorful films of the year despite the rather gloomy topic."", '\'The Room Next Door (2024)\' is Pedro Almodóvar\'s first English-language feature. Starring Tilda Swinton and Julianne Moore, the film basically touches on what it\'s like to live when you know you\'re going to die (something that we all have to grapple with, whether we realise it or not). There\'s a poignant line that goes something like ""there are lots of ways to live inside a tragedy"", and that basically sums up the point of the picture: even though all of our lives must end, that doesn\'t mean we can\'t live them with hope and purpose and joy. Although it meanders around while it gets to that point, it doesn\'t necessarily waste any screen time. Its various plot threads and seemingly inconsequential scenes all actually build towards its main message, and the more obviously important stuff is used to build the relationship of the two characters at its core. Even though it is touching at times, a lot of it is a little dry. Most of the movie consists of conversations in which people straight-up tell someone else how they feel, which can sometimes feel a little clunky. A lot of it is typical Spanish melodrama but acted in English, which can lead to a sort of off-kilter vibe to some of the dialogue. It\'s also a lot less vibrant than your usual Almodóvar picture, even though it\'s shot nicely and has a notable personality. What keeps even its driest segments completely watchable is the strength of its performers, all of whom bring an understated charm to their roles. This definitely isn\'t any of their best work, but it\'s often keenly observed and constantly engaging. Ultimately, although it\'s definitely middling Almodóvar, the piece is entertaining and affecting enough to keep you watching from beginning to end. It\'s never exactly what you think it might be, and it does have well-defined themes that are conveyed in a realistic way. It\'s not massively moving and it does have its duller segments, but it\'s a decent effort nevertheless.', ""The Room Next Door is a deceptively simple yet profoundly emotional film. Pedro Almodóvar presents a situation between two women that, while abrupt at first glance, flows with remarkable grace and authenticity.\n\nTilda Swinton and Julianne Moore deliver great performances, with Moore having a slight edge. Her portrayal is understated yet powerful, capturing raw emotions in a way that feels both effortless and deeply moving.\n\nDespite the lack of meaningful conflict in some scenes, what makes this film stand out is its realism. It doesn't rely on shocking twists or over-the-top dramatics. Instead, it thrives in its quiet moments, allowing the emotions to resonate loudly within the silence. It's a film that feels like life, subtle, messy, and achingly honest."", 'Pedro Almodóvar\'s latest film, ""The Room Next Door"", is a poignant and visually stunning exploration of friendship, mortality, and dignity in the face of death. Adapted from Sigrid Nunez\'s novel *What Are You Going Through*, the movie marks Almodóvar\'s first foray into English-language cinema and features Tilda Swinton and Julianne Moore in deeply compelling roles.\n\nThe story revolves around Ingrid (Moore), a writer, and Martha (Swinton), a former war correspondent facing terminal cancer. Martha asks Ingrid to be present in the adjoining room as she plans to end her life through euthanasia, setting the stage for a reflective, intimate narrative. Almodóvar skillfully avoids making the film a polemic on euthanasia, instead focusing on the emotional layers of their friendship, filled with shared memories, unspoken tensions, and moments of humor. Swinton embodies Martha\'s serenity and acceptance of her fate, while Moore captures Ingrid\'s anxiety and inner turmoil as she grapples with the reality of Martha\'s decision.\n\nThe film balances heavy themes with moments of levity and beauty, showcasing Almodóvar\'s signature visual style, from bold color palettes to evocative, intimate framing. The performances are to be praised, and Swinton and Moore\'s chemistry is riveting as their characters navigate the complexities of life and death. Still I have hard time to believe their friendship beacuse there is something contrived and forced.\n\nAnyway the director\'s exploration of mortality is as rich and thought-provoking resonating with themes from his earlier films like *Pain and Glory* and the film is an unforgettable meditation on what it means to truly show up for someone in their final moments, making.', ""Story could be good. But something is totally wrong with the way the movies sounds in terms of dialogues. Feels like someone took a proper film and cut it badly having to leave only 'essential' phrases. Most often scenes do not have that entry that makes culmination feasible and striking. Instead, each scene seems to be cut just to its major message.\n\nDialogues thus feel sour, sometimes smelling like clichés. What could have been powerful moments, just browsed through like a deck of cards. Talents of actresses do not save them.\n\nSometimes it felt like the script was written in another language and then translated.\n\nRight ingredients. But bad tasting dish, regretfully."", ""There is something special in thematically exploring death, a dreadful and concerning idea for those who cannot conciliate their present situation as living beings with the idea of their life coming to an end. An idea that sooner or later, as finite beings, will become a reality and will find us unprepared, although little will matter after it because we will no longer be here to experience it. Pedro Almodóvar first film in English follows Ingrid (Julianne Moore) and Martha (Tilda Swinton), two writers whose friendship dates many decades since they were young and now a strange situation reunites them again like never before. A situation that will make their relationship stronger but also question their beliefs about life and death.\n\nDirected by Pedro Almodóvar and co-written with Sigrid Nunez, The Room Next Door is based on the novel by Nunez, What Are You Going Through, from 2020 in which a woman helps her terminally ill friend to end her life by accompanying her in her last days. This is a movie that could be seen as a synthesis of Almodóvar's oeuvre given how many elements in it resemble different movies of him. It gives Almodóvar the possibility to explore the fear of death, his love for movies, and partying.\n\nThe story is honest in its aim and simple in its form, but thematically long-reaching. Ingrid is a renowned author that by a chance encounter in one of her signing events is told a friend of her has cancer. This leads her to reconnect with Martha after many years of not seeing each other. Martha, like Ingrid, is a writer, but while Ingrid writes fiction, Martha is a war correspondent for the New York Times. Almodóvar's lyricism traces symmetries with past and present in the lives of the two friends but also with many world-known authors like Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, creating a constant back and forth that seamlessly weaves its continuity. It does not take long for Martha to tell her friend her prospects with cancer. The disease that is consuming her without any reasonable hope other than to prolong her days since it is inoperable.\n\nFear of death is explored in such a profound way that, even if you are not in Martha's situation, it is easy to find oneself not only emphasizing with her but also ruminating about the subject in many different ways. At its core, dying with dignity is what interests the story to illustrate. This is examined in Martha's experience, for instance, with the cancer community that feels like the best battle against the disease is to never lose hope, something Swinton's character sees as wrong since she considers that said war can be won by dying on her own terms without letting cancer reach her. It is also interesting how, besides the physical manifestation of the disease taking more power over the body, the process is experienced in terms of identity and psychology. According to Martha, her head is spinning, and she is losing enjoyment of what previously made her happy, like listening to music, reading, etc. The narrowing of interests is not exclusive to her because other character also experiences this as he grew older. Damian (John Turturro) is someone who connects Ingrid and Martha by having dated each of them. He is convinced climate change will be the doom of the world, and the lack of attention to it by both politicians and society is alarming, to say the least. By incorporating Damian, Almodóvar changes, if only momentarily, the thematic axis of the film and introduces us to another very contemporary political issue. His dexterity in doing so is such that it never feels like a departure but rather a further exploration of the microcosm he created. One where politics is equally important to the story itself."", ""This movie is a beautiful depiction of a woman named Martha (Tilda Swinton) who is battling terminal ovarian cancer and discovering that only one of her friends, Ingrid (Julianne Moore) whose a distant friend, steps up to assist her in a difficult decision to leave this world on Martha's own terms.\n\nTilda brings a stoic humor to the screen, which paired well with Julianne's sweet, articulate character, Ingrid. We later learn that Martha has an estranged daughter Michelle (also played by Tilda Swinton), which was fun to see. Also, John Tuturro playing Damian was fun to watch. He definitely brought the quirky romantic to the story.\n\nIt's a sensitive subject, however, Director/Writer Pedro Almodóvar was magnificent in presenting a personal decision with honor and dignity. Almodóvar brought to light the dark side of dealing with a terminal illness, when a patient doesn't have any family or close friends they can depend on."", ""Disclaimer: I am a cancer survivor.\n\nWith that in mind this is what I thought. I truly enjoyed the way life and death was handled. The bond created between a patient and a caregiver was very authentic.\n\nOf course when you get Julianne Moore and Tilda Swinton across from each other every scene seems magic, so real, and I almost felt like I was intruding in a private conversation.\n\nWhy a 9? Because I wasn't convinced that after not seeing each other for a long time they reconnected and were back to best friends. Does that really happen in real life?\n\nCancer is such a personal and private journey you want someone familiar with your situation.\n\nI would like to watch it again."", 'The Room Next Door tells the story of two childhood friends who reconnected and discovers that one of them is not that well. They decide to embark on a journey, a room next to each other - and try something out.\n\nOk, the first half is very stilted. Almodóvar\'s script is far too literal and feels like google translated. Like his short last year, its wordy and far too detailed. It feels like the cadence definitely feels foreign. It makes it quite noticeable to take seriously at times BUT I could gloss over it. There is a certain campy charm in this that does not work with his Pascal short.\n\nIt\'s both main actresses going for it.\n\nPersonally, I find Swinton a bit distracting in the beginning. She played it far too cold. There is a sense of warmth and emotionality that is present in Almodóvar\'s work that clearly feels ""Latin"" for the lack of a better word. I think she played against it Almodóvar\'s type - but at least she played it consistently. You attune to her muted style as the film went along and she literally has ridiculous stories that keeps it interesting still\n\nI am personally shocked that it is Swinton who is getting acclaimed when Moore literally plays it by Almodovar\'s standard. Love her - easygoing, vivacious but defiantly intrigued character, bumbling her way to Swinton\'s life. Also, she literally is such a director\'s pet. She changes her style and fits with the film\'s tone. I am not the biggest fan of Haynes, but she always makes those choices that I feel lifts the material. She literally changes again in this. Such a smart actress who is the true chameleon of films.\n\nThis is my favorite of the QCinema films. I suppose.', ""Pedro Almodóvar once again takes us to a slightly surreal visual journey with many trusted tropes we all have gotten used to.\n\nWhat I ended up wanting was that this film was perhaps in Spanish as the dialogue in English seemed stunted and unnatural.\n\nI didn't end up believing the characters and somehow there was not much chemistry between anyone really.\n\nSome scenes felt unnecessary as they didn't drive the story in any way or add any depth to already quite thin characters.\n\nBoth leads are oozing charisma but that wasn't enough to take it to the next level.\n\nI recommend this film if you need any tips for decorating and/or colour schemes."", ""Almodovar has done it again. He is a genius at tackling sensitive topics that people struggle to talk about. Mostly taboo subjects that he covers in his films in a subtle way without it being offensive. He's a master at it really. His films always become something you talk about and discuss afterwards. I've been following Almodovar since his beginnings as a director and am completely enthralled every time I see his films. He was smart who took control of his works and started his own film company. The fact that this time he is making a film in English for the first time is not disturbing at all. Almodovar's essence remains in every frame of the film and is so wonderful. This movie is as brilliant as usual. I am just happy and can't say more than you must watch this movie and just enjoy every frame of this movie. Pure joy. ENJOY."", 'No pun intended - the story and the characters are more than interesting. But I do have to agree with something I have read from someone else: it does feel weird at times and not in a good sense. I don\'t feel that the script was written in a different language and then translated into English (although we are talking about Almodovar, so ... maybe that did happen) ... but it does feel as if the actors have trouble with the dialog ... or rather the emotion of it ... kind of delivering them with a modicum of emotions ... a very small amount of it to be more precise.\n\nThat all said, it may feel even heavier, because you know what great actors are at work here. Whatever the case, if you are able to overlook those ""flaws"" than the morality of it all ... the questions this asks ... well what is life? What is worth living for? And how should we say goodbye? Because as much as we distance ourselves from it, disconnect and not really think about it (would be quite the downer ... thinking about our demise/death all day and/or every day) ... it will catch up with us.\n\nSo while there is not much here apart from that ... it is enough for a suspenseful and interesting movie to say the least. Leave the morals at the door (or keep them down(stairs)) ... and just ""enjoy"" the story and the morality plus philosophical points ... plus Torturo and his bitter old man schtick ... gotta love it!', ""One of my favourite films is Sex, Lies and Videotape; a minimalist masterpiece of intensity that gets so much from just two actors in a room talking to one another. The Room Next Door has no intensity and feels more like a long IKEA advert until right near the end.\n\nI saw this on the big screen and there are lots of extreme close ups, so I couldn't help noticing everyone's teeth, as well as everyone's red eyes. Were they all taking bong hits? This might explain odd bits of stuttering and flat performances. One good thing about all the close ups is you can see Tilda Swinton and John Turturro are natural actors; they don't look nervous.\n\nI've seen maybe 10 Pedro Almodovar films and It goes to show that reading subtitles makes the viewing experience seem busier, funnier and generally better. If you don't believe me try watching one of those Asian animated films that has been dubbed compared to a subtitled version."", ""A beautiful and moving chamber piece on the theme of life and death. Pedro Almodóvar once the enfant terrible of Spanish cinema deals with mortality and the question of assisted dying.\n\nI loved the intimate portrayal of the relationship between two old friends, one of whom is now dying from cancer. There are many literary references, especially James Jocyce's The Dead. Falling snow is a strong motif throughout. Brilliant performances from Tilda Swinton, Julianne Moore, and John Turturro.\n\nAlmodóvar's close-up camera work is unsparing and his use of colour and settings bring life to what could have been a sombre film, especially in the final scenes with Tilda Swinton. It lived up to my expectations and I look forward to seeing it again hopefully in the privacy of my own home where I will have more opportunity to fully appreciate and reflect on this profound film."", 'Despite its serious theme (Euthanasia) the film is supremely boring, disconnected and not emotionally involving at all. I wonder how it could win the Golden Lion at Venice Film Festival. The interconnected stories just don\'t make any sense (see the gay Carmelite friars interpolation). The character played by Turturro is flat and uninteresting. The script sounds like political propaganda and it doesn\'t come from the heart. Come on Pedro, you can do better than this... I\'m not absolutely sure that Tilda Swinton was the best choice for this role but since The Human Voice she seems to feature in all of Almodovar\'s English language mpvies. There have been many films made on euthanasia (such as Amenabar\'s ""Mar Adentro"") that are certainly better worthy of notice than this frankly mediocre sample.', ""A very difficult subject is addressed in a frank and at the same time subtle way. Dialogue, lighting, camera, directions and acting are OK. The director is a veteran. The resxult however is an uncomfortable and unnecessary film that I cannot recommend. In La Habitación De Al Lado, Almodóvar deals with death through the bond of two friends. When one has to help the other in the decision of euthanasia, philosophical, political, religious and loving reflections emerge. What is life? What do we do with condemned life? This ain't pure aesthetic narrative elegance, the dialogues lack power , an unterminable and very theatrical, stagey mano-a-mano takes place. The chemistry between the two protagonists is most restrained & least nuanced, challenging the viewer in the face of a pseudo-taboo theme, namely illness and inevitable death."", ""This movie is so bad that it could have been a smart black parody of dramatic dialogues about death but this unfortunately is not the case here. Unnatural and declarative scenes reminding a Woody Allen monologue sans the irony. The script sounded like it was written and performed by AI. Weird, right?! Cinematography was brilliant which made the experience even more disconnected. How this film won awards is beyond me and poses a question about how people perceive cinema in general or how they perceive thoughts and emotions even.\n\nWith all of that said, I do have appreciated greatly some of Almodovar's storytelling and early films so a lot more why-s that happened."", ""Almodóvar's movie worlds have always been interesting to inhabit and his first English language feature is no exception to that in that all parts of the art world are beautifully present and presented: Literature is read (Joyce) , books are never far away anyhow, architecture, furniture, paintings, decoration, all refer to an intellectually challenging world where every sophisticated being in this world would eagerly like to be part of.\n\nHowever, despite this constant referencing to works of art, the movie feels empty and hollow, intellectually and emotionally not that engaging. The music by Iglesias is beautiful, opening credits are quintessential Almodóvar and Moore and Swinton are two of the greatest actresses alive, but the script is too simple to take this beyond a merely simply staged play. For example, Swinton is a former war correspondent but this never adds an interesting touch to the movie. The same for Moore who is a writer, but almost nothing is done with that element here. Another interesting part of the story is where Swinton seems to manipulate Moore in her guilt and goodheartedness, but it is also too underdeveloped.\n\nAlmodóvar's direction of both Moore and Swinton is overall too absent, so it is difficult to see what he wants from them. (See how Fincher in Swinton's small role in last year's The Killer makes her perfecly fitting the movie, with great attention to body movement and diction). Here characters and stories from the past pop up and go, yes just like in real life, but that doesn't make compelling viewing. Turturro (Almodóvar?) is especially helpless in this movie with not only uninteresting lines but a character with a simplistic political message and world view.\n\nThis is a movie where the parts all do their work relatively nice, but the sum of it all is disappointing, and the director is unfortunately to blame for that. In Dolor and gloria he bravely put his own pain to the forefront, but like Woody Allen his big inspiration seems to be over and his movies are mere copies and abstractions of previous ideas. The movie references Bergman's Persona, but is a shadow of this work of art. (Also the 1 minute trailer contains the whole movie.)\n\nA last note: That this won the Golden Lion in Venice this year is not only an indication of how weak the 2024 edition of the festival was, but as usual also a sum of the composition of the jury this time presided by Huppert: first prize to a movie about a woman who wants to be euthanized, second prize about a woman torn apart by war, love and her community, and the third price about a woman fighting for abortion. Maybe it is an idea to let filmmakers be presidents of the jury instead of actors and actresses so the best film would have won the biggest prize (The Brutalist)."", ""Rating - 4.1: Overall, a bad movie that feels lazily put together; the quality of the direction and writing are so bad that they feel next to 'The Room'.\n\nDirection - Bad: The direction on a macroscale feels very simple, lazy, and unfocused; the direction on a microscale feels unnatural and poorly executed, despite some good moments from these two experienced actors; the storytelling is incredibly simple\n\nStory - Very Bad: The concept is interesting, it's just not put together well; the plot structure is very simplistic; character writing should be a lot better than it is, given what this movie is about, but the writing is just so shallow it ruins any opportunity to construct interesting characters\n\nScreenplay - Very Bad: The dialogue is atrocious and unnatural; people do not talk this way; the dialogue was written as if the first draft was in a different language and then put through Google Translate to translate it to English; the dialogue is next door in quality to 'The Room'; the humor is unintentionally funny because of how bad the writing is; the symbolism is not presented well; the foreshadowing is pretty overt\n\nActing - Pretty Bad: Tilda Swinton - Decent (It has some moments that are truly memorable and shows some range of depth, but the material and direction are just so bad that it is hard to take this performance seriously; her chemistry with Julianne Moore is not that good), Julianne Moore - Pretty Bad (Given very poor direction and material to work with as you can tell she is restricted from showing her natural ability; has bad chemsitry with Swinton), John Turturro - Pretty Bad (Really a minor character, as the movie is really about the two leads, but still is a victim of the bad material and direction), Rest of the cast - Bad (The movie is really about the two leads, but the minor characters are given very bad dialogue and direction that they really cannot do anything)\n\nScore - Pretty Bad: The composition is pretty good; it's just that it is poorly used in the movie and is poorly mixed at times, as it drowns out what is going on screen\n\nCinematography - Bad: Simple and lazy\n\nEditing - Bad: Simple and lazy\n\nSound - Bad: The music is poorly mixed into the movie, and this drowns out what is going on onscreen\n\nPacing - Pacing is incredibly slow given how bad the dialogue is and how little plot there actually is\n\nClimax - The climax is anticlimactic and borderline funny with what actually happens\n\nTone - Tone is supposed to be a drama, but the movie and writing are so bad that it comes off as a black comedy\n\nFinal Notes - I saw the premiere at the Austin Film Festival."", ""I seldom write reviews, I love Almodóvar and looked forward to watching this film at the cinema even when I didn't know what it was about beforehand. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this movie at all. I left the cinema with the feeling a train had ran over me.\n\nThis movie is terribly sad. It movie is about death , friendship, abandonment, generosity, how some people don't enjoy life in preparation of death and how some people still enjoy life even when they have death surrounding them. The rest, we didn't catch.\n\nI strongly recommend to not watch if you feel a bit sad and definitely Not apt for a Sunday night!!"", '""The Room Next Door"" starts with an interesting premise, but that\'s about the only positive thing that can be said about this limp, uninspired film. Almodóvar, once a master of emotional complexity and vivid storytelling, seems to have forgotten how to make a film that feels authentic or engaging. What could have been an exploration of human vulnerability and intimacy quickly devolves into a predictable, first-degree melodrama that leans far too heavily on tired clichés.\n\nThe central theme, though intriguing, is handled with such a lack of subtlety and depth that it never feels fresh or compelling. Instead of delving into complex emotional landscapes, the story relies on formulaic twists and a shallow treatment of its characters. We know exactly where it\'s going from the moment it starts, and by the time it gets there, it feels like an effort in futility. The so-called ""twists"" are more like tired plot devices pulled from a drawer of clichés, and the dramatic moments fall flat-because there\'s no real buildup, no real emotional stakes.\n\nBut it\'s the acting that truly sinks the film. Honestly, this is some of the worst acting I\'ve seen in recent memory. The performances are so wooden and unconvincing that they seem more like an amateur theater production than a feature film. The actors seem lost, unsure of their characters\' motivations, or perhaps they were just given the worst material to work with. Not a single performance feels genuine or emotionally grounded. There\'s no chemistry between the leads, no spark or tension, just an endless parade of awkward pauses and stilted line deliveries that undermine any attempt at sincerity.\n\nAlmodóvar, who has worked with incredible talent in the past, seems to have failed in drawing out anything remotely memorable or engaging from his cast here. The characters speak in overly dramatized lines, each one more forced than the last, without any of the wit or insight that Almodóvar\'s best films are known for. Instead of feeling like real people with real struggles, they feel like poorly-written caricatures in a film that doesn\'t seem to care enough to let them develop.\n\nVisually, ""The Room Next Door"" might try to evoke Almodóvar\'s signature style-colorful sets, meticulously designed costumes, and a sense of theatricality-but it all falls flat. The visual flair that once enhanced his characters and themes now feels superficial and out of place. The scenes feel more like artifice than artistry, and the bold color schemes and set designs end up being distractions rather than emotional tools.\n\nIn short, ""The Room Next Door"" is a massive disappointment. Despite its interesting theme, it never rises above first-degree melodrama, relying too much on clichés and the kind of tired tropes that Almodóvar used to subvert with such brilliance. The acting is dreadful, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the story is as predictable as it is forgettable. Almodóvar\'s charm and depth are nowhere to be found in this hollow, lazy attempt to recapture the magic of his earlier films. Fans hoping for another ""Talk to Her"" or ""All About My Mother"" will be sorely let down. This film is a textbook example of how even the most interesting concepts can be ruined by poor execution.', 'Watching Almodóvar\'s latest film ""The Room Next Door"" feels almost as if you\'re watching some sort of comedy- wether it\'s intentional or not, I\'m not sure but it was definitely worth a watch.\n\nThe Room Next Door follows the character Ingrid, who out of a sheer coincidence she gets to know about the condition of her friend, Martha who is terminally ill in cancer. They both reconnect, and in their reconnecting Martha cooks up a plan to end her life, with her friend by her side.\n\nFirst of all... I gotta say this movie is so funny, like unintentionally so, I can\'t believe that I\'m saying it but the tone and the delivery of these lines is just so funny. I\'m not sure if it\'s because of Almodovar\'s Spanish language becomes something else when translated to English or maybe it\'s because the absurdity of these situations in the movie put a layer of humour that feels very unintentional, concerning the subjects touched in the movie.\n\nThe positives, I love the set designs, the clothes, some of the story beads are kind of compelling- you want to know more about them. Also the performances of Julianne More and Tilda Swinton is great, I really liked seeing their friendship on the screen, it was acted in a very tender and human way that I liked to see. Even if they were fighting for their lives to keep the screenplay tone serious it just felt like it fell apart, every single way.\n\nI guess ultimately where the movie falls apart is in both story and tone, here Almodóvar lays too many loose threads in the story that have no impact in the overall story or really make sense for the plot. There\'s a contrived subplot about the world and it\'s eco crisis that really doesn\'t go anywhere. And also characters that hop in and hop out without them even impacting the story. You could basically delete all of the scenes that John Turturro was in and it wouldn\'t matter. Also the ending is very bad, it doesn\'t really go anywhere or it doesn\'t really tie what has happened in the story.\n\nAll in all, I\'d say it\'s worth a watch. In all the wrong ways though, I found this film funny but I don\'t think it was the intention. I feel like Almodóvar should take a big break, watch some of his own movies and see where it all went wrong.']",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/o-quarto-ao-lado/3d9fa025-6ed7-48e5-9f0d-56320a39473d.webp

Whether that makes it feel appropriately epic or too often dull will probably depend on the viewer.\n\nIt's also the kind of movie where I'm not sure overanalysing will help. Coppola is trying to say so much in one film, and a good part of it comes out nonsensical as a result. There were a few points during the film where I wondered if it was all some practical joke.

The guy is a cinematic legend who just decided to throw all caution (and coherence) to the wind and go full mad scientist on this. It's a glorious, unfiltered mess from the mind of a genius who clearly stopped caring about what anyone thinks. Bravo, you magnificent lunatic! 👏🏻"", 'In Hollywood, even the best directors can spend years trying to get a project off the ground. George Miller first came up with the idea for \'Mad Max: Fury Road\' 28 years before it was released; Clint Eastwood sat on the script for \'Unforgiven\' for over a decade, as did Robert Duvall with \'The Apostle\'. Martin Scorsese considered making \'Gangs of New York\' as far back as 1970, while it took Terry Gilliam nearly 30 years to complete \'The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\'.\n\nWere it not for their director\'s relentless passion, projects like these would go unrealized, and the world would be missing some truly great cinema. Conversely, after such a long gestation period, there is a risk that that same passion can cloud creative judgment, resulting in works that are more self-indulgent than impactful. Such is the case with Francis Ford Coppola\'s \'Megalopolis,\' a meandering, exasperating epic that took the great director over 47 years to make.\n\nCoppola is undeniably a filmmaking genius, however his best works were done in the 1970\'s and early 80\'s. His output has been more miss than hit since then, and his semiretirement after 1997\'s \'The Rainmaker\' seemed to indicate that he was tired of the movie business. For years, he appeared content to relax on his vineyard, making the odd low-budget indie flick, while sporadically reediting and rereleasing his older films whenever there was a bad grape year. However, \'Megalopolis\' was never far from his mind and, after falling back in love with the idea, finally began filming in 2022, nearly half a century after he first thought of it in 1977.\n\nEntirely self-funded, it is set in the not-too-distant future in the decadent, debauched city of New Rome, centring on visionary architect Cesar Catilina, the inventor of a miraculously versatile substance called Megalon. He has a vision for the future of the city, which is at odds with that of the Mayor Franklyn Cicero. Drawing heavily on Roman history, particularly the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC, the film delves into themes of societal decay, corruption and the eternal struggle between progress and regression. On paper, it sounds fascinating, especially with Coppola at the helm.\n\nRegretfully, Coppola\'s execution does not match his ambition. He aims to weave a grand narrative that merges historical allegory with futuristic vision, but stumbles with his storytelling. The plot meanders, losing focus amid its myriad subplots and philosophical digressions. This lack of cohesion leaves one adrift in a sea of ideas that, while initially intriguing, do not coalesce into a compelling whole.\n\nFurthermore, Coppola\'s exploration of the aforementioned themes has been seen before in countless other pictures (perhaps most obviously Fritz Lang\'s \'Metropolis\', which came out nearly 100 years ago and still feels more relevant) making the film feel oddly hackneyed. Coppola\'s ideas do not feel fresh nor innovative (when they are comprehensible, that is- which they frequently aren\'t) and the parallels he draws between ancient Rome and society today feel ham-fisted and obvious.\n\nAdditionally, proceedings are burdened with pretentious, stilted dialogue and banal narration that sounds like the semi-coherent mumblings of a majorly stoned student minoring in philosophy. Moreover, his characters aren\'t compelling and the tone is all over the place, oscillating wildly between self-serious drama and unintentional comedy. This tonal inconsistency further detracts from the film\'s impact, leaving one unsure whether to ponder deeply or chuckle at the absurdity of it all.\n\nConversely, it is a stunning looking film; even though the heavy-handed CGI ranges from barely serviceable to incredibly obvious. Alongside director of photography Mihai Malaimare Jr., Coppola has crafted a world that is both striking and unsettling, blending the opulence of ancient Rome with the sleek, cold aesthetics of a futuristic utopia. Their use of light and shadow, as well as colour, creates a visual narrative arguably more compelling than the story itself.\n\nThis is compounded by Beth Mickle and Bradley Rubin\'s lush production design (both of whom exited the production before filming wrapped due to ""creative differences""), as well as Lisa K. Sessions\'s intricate set decoration. Further, Milena Canonero\'s costume design is similarly stylish and effective, combining varying styles, contributing to the overall era-defying mise en scène.\n\nYet, visual splendour alone cannot save \'Megalopolis\' from its narrative shortcomings. It is, quite simply put, a mess of ideas without a clear central point. The film\'s ambition is admirable, but feels like a collection of disjointed concepts rather than a cohesive story. Plot points aren\'t explored thoroughly, nor contribute to the overall narrative; namely Cesar\'s bizarrely inconsequential and pointless ability to stop time. Moreover, characters are introduced and discarded without much thought, leaving their arcs incomplete and unsatisfying.\n\nAdditionally, as alluded to above, Coppola\'s exploration of the grand themes at play, while interesting, lacks the nuanced execution seen in his earlier works. The film\'s philosophical digressions, rather than enriching the narrative, serve to muddle it, leaving viewers confused. Further, Osvaldo Golijov\'s score is unremarkable, and the lax editing ensures that it feels much longer than it is, suffering from a dearth of momentum or flow.\n\nDespite its flaws, though, \'Megalopolis\' does offer rare moments that remind one of Coppola\'s talent. There are scenes of breathtaking beauty and intrigue, hinting at what could have been with a more focused narrative. However, these moments are few and far between, making for an uneven glimpse into a brilliant mind rather than a fully realized masterpiece.\n\nThe performances, too, are uneven. As Cesar, Adam Driver comes across as detached from the material when he isn\'t grandiosely over-the-top. While Cesar is ostensibly a genius, Driver\'s portrayal makes him seem more like a tiresome diva than a visionary. As a central character, he lacks personality or charm, making him difficult to root for. Though he has delivered strong performances in the past, here Driver is as bland as unseasoned gruel.\n\nAs his love interest Julia, Nathalie Emmanuel, despite her best efforts, fails to create a compelling character in the face of Coppola\'s clichéd characterisation and weak dialogue. Similarly, Giancarlo Esposito, as Julia\'s father Franklyn Cicero, does not leave much of an impression. Neither of them elevates their roles beyond the superficial. One feels as if anyone could have played their roles with similar results.\n\nConversely, Aubrey Plaza, as the ludicrously named femme fatale reporter Wow Platinum, overcomes the terrible dialogue and cardboard-cut-out characterisation; delivering a terrific, tongue-in-cheek performance. Jon Voight seems content to overplay the role of Cesar\'s doddery rich uncle, while great actors like Talia Shire, Dustin Hoffman, Kathryn Hunter, Jason Schwartzman and James Remar are criminally underutilised; left with little more than nothing to do.\n\nAdditionally, Laurence Fishburne does fine work, even if his intermittent narration is so pompously portentous it sounds like he\'s in a Funny or Die sketch or a mockumentary. Meanwhile, as Cesar\'s cousin, Shia LaBeouf- who seems to be on a mission to outdo himself, giving increasingly terrible performances- is so self-indulgent, over-the-top and hammy that it\'s almost a parody of bad acting.\n\nThe film exemplifies the pitfalls of unchecked ambition. Without critical oversight, Coppola\'s vision sprawled into a self-indulgent narrative. The absence of external feedback and editorial control led to a lack of cohesion, while Coppola\'s reported choice to improvise scenes on the day led to ludicrous, stilted dialogue and inconsistent performances. Without anyone to tell him ""No,"" it seems Coppola indulged in every whim and idea, no matter how tangential or underdeveloped. This means that what could have been a tight, impactful film instead became an overextended, indulgent spectacle of excess.\n\n47 years in the making, Francis Ford Coppola\'s \'Megalopolis\' is not in the same league as his best works. It is more akin to \'One from the Heart\' or \'Twixt\': a visually stunning film lacking narrative weight and cohesion. It\'s preachy, pontificatory pretension; a messy, bloated film failing to deliver on its grand ambitions. Although good-looking and showcasing Coppola\'s relentless drive and passion for cinema, if \'Megalopolis\' is the future, it might be better to stay in the past.', ""Megalopolis: the greatest movie-watching experience I've ever had for such a terrible trainwreck of a film. I don't know what the heck I just watched, but my god did I ever feel connected to the rest of my audience as we all suffered and laughed through it together.\n\nMegalopolis is a mess brimming with ambition but utterly devoid of direction and cohesion. It isn't just agonizing, it is an excruciating test of patience. At best, it's mind-numbing, at worst, a total trainwreck I painfully endured.\n\nBUT! It gave me an experience I will never forget. I saw this at an IMAX pre-screening that included the live actor during the movie and a live-streamed pre-screening Q&A with Francis Ford Coppola, Robert DeNiro, and Spike Lee. The Q&A was bonkers and spiraled way out of control right after it began. It was insane to watch unfold in real-time and ended up being a great pre-game for how insane the experience to come was.\n\nAnd wow was it ever so much fun - laughing along with a full audience of cinephiles at the absurdity of this movie. And before you ask, no this is not a comedy, we were laughing at the movie. And yes, I feel bad, this is the legendary Francis Ford Coppola's passion project with a heavy artistic, experimental vision to it, but it just was such a hot mess that I couldn't help it. Luckily, I wasn't alone. And while the movie was largely a failure, this was the most connected I've felt to an audience and film community since seeing Avengers: Endgame for the first time. So while I will probably NEVER see this movie again, I am so thankful to have had the experience I did seeing it.\n\nI genuinely cannot believe this movie is real. Needs to be seen to be believed. I have never seen a movie quite like this before. Better or worse, Coppola made the movie he wanted to make, and it's as strange and bizarre and imaginative and insane as you expect, in every single department. Part of me thinks the movie knows how insane it is, and it just gives zero craps. But who knows? I just have no clue how to actually write about it. Frankly, I could barely explain the movie to you if I tried.\n\nYou can tell Francis Ford Coppola thinks a lot about the Roman Empire because its influence is all over the mega failure that is Megalopolis. Themes of time, history, legacy, civilization, technology, politics, the media, and economics are all touched upon in this golden sun-baked, grandiose, overstuffed, and overwritten piece of filmmaking but with little to zero cohesion between them. While Francis Ford Coppola may have made some of the greatest films of all time in the 70s, Megalopolis is not one of those movies. Every member of this cast feels lost as they deliver some of the funniest line readings you'll likely hear all year. (I think Aubrey Plaza was the only one who KNEW what kind of movie she was in.) Some will appreciate the scale and ambition of Megalopolis. I would've admired it more if any of it worked, but at least I'll never forget the incoherent, messy, WTF experience of it all. Feel like I just witnessed an important moment in film history."", 'I so desperately wanted to be part of the minority who enjoyed Megalopolis. However, what an abhorrent nightmare; or maybe a fever dream is more accurate. There\'s no doubt that the actual bundle of ideas that make up Francis Ford Coppola\'s ""masterpiece"" are incredibly unique and interesting. The problem is the execution of those ideas and the dialogue that connects them together. I am obsessed with the idea of New Rome and all these quasi Roman characters plotting against each other like a Shakespearean Game of Thrones. But listening to Adam Driver give a quote from Hamlet and then immediately saying ""in the clurrrrb"" and Jon Voight saying ""boner"" are just unforgivable. I roughly understand the plot of Megalopolis, but I cannot even begin to fathom why any character does anything they say or do. The amount of talent that was wasted on what has to be one of the most beautiful, visually stunning backdrops, is disrespectfully confusing. With all of that being said, I will probably cause myself to suffer an additional viewing of Megalopolis, just to be sure I\'m sure the experience was so exhausting.', '""Megalopolis"" is a film I wanted to like, primarily because it\'s an incredibly expensive indie project, written, produced, financed, and directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola-an auteur who has been planning this work for 40 years and loves it so much that he personally rated it 10/10 on the film platform Letterboxd. Moreover, the experience of sitting in a nearly empty IMAX theater with just a few others added to the atmosphere... However, aside from Adam Driver\'s Oscar-worthy performance and the stunning visual frames that looked beautiful on the massive screen, nothing else in this film is worth praising.\n\nThe plot follows the genius scientist Cesar, inventor of the revolutionary material ""Megalon,"" with which he plans to build a utopian city of the future-""Megalopolis."" This is one of the film\'s central themes-obsession with perfection in a world and society far from it. Envy, jealousy, greed, and the lust for power are other themes that shape the essence of this work. Coppola doesn\'t shy away from weaving in political commentary as well as reflections on human existence.\n\nWhen I reflect on the film\'s themes, one might think this is a good film. On the contrary, all of these themes are destroyed by narrative chaos, which in my opinion stems from the director\'s pretentious ambition to present an unprecedented \'megalomaniac\' work of art. The editing and narrative are disjointed-the film jumps from scene to scene with no coherence, which became tiresome after just fifteen minutes. By the midpoint, I had completely lost interest in the story and was simply waiting for it to end.\n\nEven though most of the cast is well-known, it\'s difficult to connect with any of the characters-most are shallow, and some are entirely unnecessary. The only character I connected with was Cesar, thanks to Adam Driver\'s brilliant performance. His ability to convey Cesar\'s mania, dialogue, and emotions is likely the reason I stayed engaged at all, rather than the depth of the character itself. The dialogue is mixed-sometimes brilliant, sometimes dull-which made the experience quite uneven.\n\nThe cinematography is excellent, and had Coppola focused primarily on this element, this could have been an extraordinary film.\n\nIn conclusion, I can say that due to its impressive cinematography, I can\'t consider ""Megalopolis"" a bad film, but because of its awful narrative structure, I also can\'t recommend it to anyone. It\'s disjointed, unsure of which themes to focus on, and unclear about what it truly wants to convey. Uncertain in its very purpose.', ""On one hand, this film has some interesting ideas and visuals, but some ideas never evolve, and some visuals don't look good.\n\nIt's challenging to understand what Coppola's intention was with this film. It seems like he chose not to focus too much on characters but rather on themes. However, some scenes suggest that the audience should feel empathy for the characters, but one simply can't. One reason for that is the pacing of this film; it somehow manages to be fast, yet feel slow, and that might be because some scenes are dull. If we remove all the misleading character development, we are left with misleading idea development. Megalopolis bombards you with interesting ideas, but because there are quite a few of them, none of them evolves into a solid conclusion. As I already mentioned, it's hard to see where Coppola was going with all of this.\n\nIf his intention was to go against the classical narrative structure and challenge viewers with a different type of storytelling, then that didn't work either. Some scenes contain clichés, and the overall structure feels like a mix of 50s to 90s scenery. One interesting thing the movie does frequently is plant a seed that sometimes does not grow-it stays in that scene, and then we move to the next one. This method of storytelling is misleading and confusing for most audiences, and it probably would work better if this technique had a solid foundation throughout the whole film. But it simply does not feel right.\n\nDavid Lynch once said that you can make any film, any art the way you want, as long as it feels right. His films are stranger and more difficult to understand than Megalopolis, yet when you watch Lynch's work, you don't feel misled-everything feels right, no matter how strange it is. Megalopolis sometimes feels right, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nMegalopolis is a good example of how the director's stylistic touch matters to the look of the movie. The cinematography of this film was done by the same person who shot The Master. Yet this film feels like any expensive commercial shot today-too vivid, too warm, too basic.\n\nI will definitely rewatch this film in the future, all jokes aside. This film has a shtick to it that I didn't quite get the first time watching. Overall, it's a bit sad that this is Coppola's last film, but I'm sure he has no regrets making it. After all, this is the guy who made Apocalypse Now, and I will respect him forever for his contribution to American cinema."", 'The mere mention of Francis Ford Coppola\'s name brings forth a multitude of breathtaking experiences. Over decades, the filmmaker has created a monumental filmography, one few directors could even dream of matching. He solidified his legacy with *The Godfather*; with *Apocalypse Now*, he became immortal. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Yet, his latest film, the long-awaited *Megalopolis*, is a bewildering cacophony, oscillating between the sublime and the awkward, between hope and dreams. Though not an outright failure, it falls short of what one would expect from such a celebrated director.\n\nThe film\'s plot revolves around the ideological clash between the prodigious architect Cesar Catalina, a Nobel laureate, and Frank Cicero, the mayor of New Rome-a futuristic New York City. While the politician governs with his eyes set on the past, relying on experience and tradition in his decisions, the architect dreams of radically transforming life through a utopia enabled by ""megalon,"" a miraculous material. Throughout the film, Coppola denounces the rampant hypocrisy and corruption of contemporary Western society. The spectacle of life, the manipulation of information, the commercialization of sex-all these are symptoms of a morally bankrupt empire, led by a decadent elite lost in excess and vanity. The only way out for such a civilization appears to be the reform envisioned by Cesar. He believes he can resolve all social contradictions through his ""megalon,"" raising a new world from the ruins of New Rome. To achieve this, he must overcome skeptics and survive the vicious.\n\nAlthough *Megalopolis* was originally conceived over twenty years ago, the discussions Coppola raises are strikingly relevant, especially in his critique of mass media and mass politics. The film has a beating heart and can engage the viewer in its most intense moments. What it unfortunately lacks, however, is structure and substance. Coppola paints his film like a Pollock painting, yet without any sense of harmony or flow in his brushstrokes, and the result is a chaotic and disjointed work. *Megalopolis* is laden with intention and argument, but it lacks direction, lacks synthesis, and fails to turn its theme into poetry. The film blends grandiose imagery, bolstered by a thunderous score, with the ridiculous, as crude visual effects bring a cheap surrealism to life. The dialogues are eloquently robotic, and they only function because of the actors who manage (which is a testament to the quality of the cast) to convey some humanity to their characters. Coppola fails to present New Rome as a believable, palpable world, which limits the viewer\'s ability to become involved. At no point does the city appear as anything more than a metonymy for America, and its inhabitants are not particularly compelling.\n\nThe film is also packed with homages to classics that inspired the director, with one scene, for instance, evoking the epic *Ben-Hur*. Amid so many tributes, one stands out, perhaps to the detriment of the film itself. From its very title, *Megalopolis*, comparisons with Fritz Lang\'s legendary *Metropolis* become inevitable. Coppola\'s production, in some ways, is almost a modern reinterpretation of the German master\'s work, with some parallels between the two films. In both, the protagonist is a wealthy young man trying to address the terrible inequalities of a futuristic society. And in both, love is a positive force that drives change-the man who loves yearns to transform society. But while *Metropolis* is flawless in its presentation, *Megalopolis* fails to convince. It does not impress with its visuals, which are largely uninteresting; it does not deliver an engaging plot, nor memorable characters. It has the virtue of saying exactly what the filmmaker wanted to say-it is assertive and confident in its message without being, however, preachy. But a dozen well-thought-out metaphors do not make a good movie.\n\nCoppola may have become a prisoner of his own myth. Many refuse to accept anything less than a masterpiece from him, and *Megalopolis*, unfortunately, is not one of his better moments. It is a film ambitious in concept but weak in execution. It engages with the issues of its time but fails to create pathos. It reaffirms faith in humanity and the transformation of the world, but it lacks a story and characters that could amplify its message. It is certainly not a triumphant return for the director, but it is not a detestable piece of work either. For viewers willing to intellectually engage with the film and forgive its flaws, *Megalopolis* can capture attention and reasonably convey its director\'s ideas. It can even entertain, as the actors are fully invested in the script\'s quirks, and there is something charming about Coppola\'s vision for the future of humanity.', 'I really admire the story and purpose but the interpretation of the younger generation was almost unbearable that I had to laugh. The acting is done very well but at the behest of a pathless plot and lack of an environment. Some scenes were simply bizarre; actors walking to different parts of the room for no reason as if I was watching a Cirque Du Soleil show without the art house beauty, the gaudy and exaggerated portrayal of the wealthy as if they are dumb pigs and just the overall delivery of direction was strange and not fun to watch. I really feel like Coppola had no one to tell him; ""Hey that\'s stupid.""', ""You can see every cent on the screen. That's the good thing about Francis Ford Coppola's latest and quite possibly last movie. Between the cast, the costuming, and the set design, which reimagines New York City as New Rome, you can see it all. The only question this raises is why was 42nd Street from Third Avenue to Times Square left unaffected, and what about the movie theaters from 7th to 8th Avenue?\n\nThat said, it is natural to be skeptical of what is essentially an admiring biopic of Robert Moses. Especially when it has apparently been written by Ayn Rand as a reply to METROPOLIS and then handed to Abel Gance after convincing him he's making a movie about Julius Caesar instead of Napoleon. And don't forget the quotations from Marcus Aurelius.\n\nIt is, in sum, a very learned movie. To appreciate the details, you need to have read extensively in Roman history, seen a lot of silent films, and be familiar with New York City in the second half of the 20th Century, including the flight of the middle and upper classes from the 1950s through the 1980s. Through the vagaries of my upbringing and a chaotic course of self-education, I can claim those things. So. What do I think?\n\nThe performances are fine. However, I am left with the question, as I am about so many movies these days, of who Coppola made this movie for. It is claimed he spent about $140 million of his own money on this feature. The general rule is that a movie has to gross about twice its production cost to break even. I can't see a large enough audience for this to produce $300,000,000 in tickets and secondary rights. It is simply too long, a shaggy dog story about love and artistic vision being more important than anything else.\n\nThis would not, of course, be the first time that Coppola has let his artistic ambitions explode on him; even though it is claimed APOCALYPSE NOW eventually made its money back, I have my doubts about that if you add in interest costs. Certainly ONE FROM THE HEART was a disaster, and he spent a couple of decades making nicely commercial movies from other sources to dig his way out, and let the wineries and restaurants make him money. Neither do I believe this movie will ruin him. There are certainly enough movies buffs around to make the net loss from this bearable.\n\nAll of which goes a long way to answering my question of who Coppola's intended audience was. It was Coppola himself, an attempt to prove himself the complete film maker, instead of the fine translator of others' well told tales. I hope he likes what he has wrought."", 'A timely movie that isn\'t for everyone. If you know a thing or two about the history of the western world, and are a fan of ""art"" movies that include symbolism and allegory, then you will appreciate this movie.\n\nEmpires don\'t last forever. They can crumble, or they can evolve, sometimes a bit of both. What path will we choose?\n\nThis movie is inspired, and it aspires to remind you of the distant and recent past that we may might be doomed to repeat if we don\'t transcend it. It hopes to inspire you to move beyond the invisible shackles of the modern remnants of the Roman empire.\n\nIt\'s also visually stunning, and beautiful in it\'s imagined potential future. The actors are extraordinarily talented and unbound by contrived lines. Bravo.', 'Obscure feelings. Megalopolis is epic and goofy mixture of different movies (Babylon, Casanova, Moulin Rouge, Cabaret, Batman, Hudsucker Proxy and Hollywoodland mini series etc.). Coppola recycles lots of styles of some famous directors like Luhrmann, Chazelle, Burton, Aronofsky, Fellini and Visconti. His own voice is somewhere there in the passing details which unfortunately reminds of his weaker films like ""One from The Heart"".\n\nThe film could\'ve been set in a more realistic location. Then the fantasy of Megalopolis would\'ve been more effective giving a wow feeling. And what is the point of the stupid and unjustified theatrecality or should I just say theatre? Personally I hate that kind of approach giving me a Baz Luhrmann puke into my mouth. It\'s eating the serious credibility of the story. Based on that point there\'s lots of loose moments without a reason: dropping the hats, some weird dance posing during the first scene and the vibe just in general.\n\nStill, I actually liked the last fourth of the film. There was thoughtful and beautiful ideas. The ending was also fine. The story is quite good with its connections to ancient Rome etc. And without the continuing interference the film could\'ve had a chance to be a decent adult fairy tale. Sadly the messy and restless theatre goofiness is just eating the entirety too much.', ""Painfully dull, self indulgent, pretentious, incoherent mess of a movie. It looks cheap, lighting feels totally off and artificial, CGI is also all over the place but mostly bad. If it had any sense of style I could probably ignore those technical shortcomings but unfortunately it doesn't. I have nothing against this type of passion projects but this one is just so damn boring and uninteresting. It´s not even so bad it´s good type of situation, it´s simply just bad. It tries soooo hard to be smart and operatic with all those archaic phrases and Shakespearean references but it's all just terribly written pointless bulls*it and the execution is somehow even worse. It is embarrassment for everyone involved.\n\nPerformances are also all over the place, everyone tries something else which makes the whole thing even messier.\n\nIf you are really that curious, I say wait for streaming... This one isn´t worth of going to cinema."", ""The greatest irony in the history of film is that man that created The Godfather created this....this mess.\n\nHow do you get great actors and have them turn in terrible performances? How do you have a ridiculously bad script and an unmotivated story and reprehensible dialogue with the budget that they had???\n\n20 minutes in I thought, something is wrong here...and somehow, the film get worse the longer you watch it. Don't be curious- save your money.\n\nOne of the worst thing I have ever seen.\n\nSometimes low budget indie films get criticized but honestly, it's very hard to make a good movie without money. BUt this film had access to MILLIONS, access to some great Hollywood stars and legends and it's still trash!"", 'What a shocker! I will be completely honest and upfront, this movie was so bad me and my friend both decided to walk out halfway through. Coppola hasn\'t directed a good movie since the 90\'s, so I didn\'t have super high hopes - but I expected more than this. The editing is so fast paced and disjointed that most scenes have no structure. The acting is all over the place, and my god the special effects are BAD. There are maybe a few of the vfx shots that were okay, but most were out of a PS2 cutscene. For my short version of the review, PLEASE don\'t go and see this for it is not worth any amount of money.\n\nFor people wondering if anything was good, there are a few things. Some shots are nice, some jokes in it are funny, and the base story is interesting. This future of New Rome and a battle for the power structure within the city is cool. However the execution makes the story seem egotistical, nonsensical, and just amateurish.\n\nI would make the argument that this movie is objectively bad and shows the directors age horribly. Coppola is like 84 years old, so his interpretation of the youth and many directing choices in this movie are just completely aged. Also, let\'s go back to the editing. Shia LeBeouf plays this prince character who is a degenerate, but I swear he never has any true conversation with anyone. It is edited so that he just says one liners for a few seconds then it cuts away. We walked out right after he says, ""Revenge is best served while wearing a dress"", or something like that.\n\nI am getting a headache just thinking about this movie. So I will end it with this. This movie is bad and Coppola should retire not only for his sake, but to save the consumer from more out-of-touch snooze fests made by old men. No this isn\'t ageism, just a really bad movie.', 'Nearly 50 years in the planning and his first film as director in 13 years, Francis Ford Coppola brings us ""Megalopolis"" a wild, bewildering, theatrical experience that takes some big and frankly unnecessary swings that almost entirely undercut the points he\'s trying to make.\n\nNew Rome is at the point of collapse. The recently elected mayor Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito) is finding his popularity crumbling as he clashes with Cesar Catalina (Adam Driver) the head of the Design Authority. The resentment is further stoked by Cicero\'s daughter Julia (Nathalie Emmanuel) working for and then entering into a relationship with Cesar. Clodio (Shia LaBeouf), Cesar\'s cousin and Wow Platinum (Aubrey Plaza) Cesar\'s ex-lover plan to exploit both the wealth of Crassus (Jon Voight) and the frustration of the population to fuel their own rise to power.\n\nSo, perhaps the oddest thing about ""Megalopois"" is that there is a relatively straight forward and potentially brilliant film at its core. The fall of ancient Rome, juxtaposed with comparisons with modern day America (or the West in general) is a great idea. I can\'t imagine that Coppola would have struggled to get a studio to help, or completely finance that pitch. The trouble is - built on that skeleton of a good idea is a film chocked full of nonsense that I can only imagine that Coppola believed so strongly in, he wouldn\'t let them go and the investors walked away. For example, and I don\'t think this is a spoiler as it was in the trailers - Adam Driver\'s Cesar Catalina can stop time. How and why is never really explained properly by the film, nor does this really function as part of the plot, he just can for seemingly aesthetic reasons.\n\nOn top of the crazy ideas, of which time stopping is only one of them, you also have other more conventional problems, such as amateurish performances, perhaps stemming from the improvisational spirit that apparently was what Coppola encouraged. There are numerous bits of the plot that don\'t go anywhere and way too many characters to service, both of which facilitate a bloated runtime.\n\nStill, I didn\'t really hate it. Aubrey Plaza is excellent, and I suppose, on some level, I\'d always prefer a big swinging failure over a safe and boring committee anodyned film. I don\'t think I\'ll ever feel the need to watch it again, but you probably need to see it, if only to believe it actually happened.', 'I\'m not sure what this movie was supposed to be about. A schizophrenic\'s whiskey-fueled dream would be more coherent. There were like 6 separate plot lines going, which were all unfinished and/or filled with holes. The transitions were comprised of this Clockwork Orange style madness that will (maybe) make sense the 8th time you watch it, and all of the information that you think is necessary is haphazardly thrown around with no context or explanation (ex. Whatever the building material was), so the whole movie ended up not being about anything really.\n\nI think this was supposed to be some surreal exploration of American society and where we are, or could be, headed. Or a romeo and julietesque love story. Or...Or...But it was really just boring and long and confusing.\n\nMr. Coppola has done some incredible work in his career, but this was a fever dream of random thoughts that he tried his best to make into a film. Period. Written, directed and produced. He Really wanted this made and I\'m not entirely sure why.\n\nLaurence Fishburne was wasted.\n\nStudents of film and people that love really strange, borderline pretentious movies with an ending that doesn\'t feel like an ending because you don\'t know how you got there (ex. Vanilla sky and magnolia) will love this. But if you, like me, were attracted to this movie because you saw statues moving and some big name actors and thought \'oh, this looks cool\' then you will be Savagely disappointed.\n\nOne last note, in my Viola Davis voice: ""Shia LeBeouf should not be playing villains...write that down."" It\'s already hard to like him in some of the movies he does, but it\'s INCREDIBLY easy to dislike him as a villian....he wasn\'t one of those characters that you love to hate either. He just came off as deuchy and cringe.\n\nIf someone reimbursed me the price of an IMAX ticket and bought me a large bucket of gourmet popcorn, I would not sit through this again.', ""The cinematography was a spectacle for sure. The special effects however, were either a strong compliment to the shot sequences or embarrassing to look at. I did enjoy the films dream aesthetic, but the dialogue was either cartoonishly hard to keep up with or felt like it served no purpose for the plot/characters.\n\nMy favorite part of the film was definitely the Virgin Pledge sequence. It also did nothing for the story, however, the song was actually good and the visual delivery was pleasing to the eyeballs.\n\nOverall, this film is definitely not for most people. I am embarrassed that I liked it. It's a terrible movie that I enjoyed for the outlandish performances that gave me a good laugh."", ""What I mean by the title of this review is that people are too used to mindless entertainment. Megalopolis was beautiful, thought provoking, well acted, well written, and super strange. Some scenes make you laugh or just wonder why. But that's the beauty of it. Some of the reviews said that it was funny and it's not a comedy. Not true. It's a comedy, a drama, a sci-fi flick, and a reflection of society. Shia LaBeouf's role is perfect for him. Same for Aubrey Plaza. In fact, every role seems to fit the character perfectly or near perfectly. Same for Adam driver. I have to say, when I saw the reviews it made me want to see it. Often the best movies are the movies that half the people hate and half of them love. I was not disappointed at all. The best movie I've seen in years. Anyways, I went to it with no expectations.

Coppola was the original theater kid making all kinds of wild stuff in the 60s. One thing I will say though is the weirdness of the movie is blown way out of proportion. It is a sad, impressionistic and apocalyptic tone poem, with magic realist elements. It is not a gonzo out-there cult film. I wonder if you have to be an artist to be fully taken by this movie, or a romantic. This is where all its power lies, through Adam Driver\'s performance. He is weary across it, while the world around him is insane, creating a fascinating parallel. This is sort of his specialty as an actor with Ferrari and House of Gucci. He is able to be the haunted visionary so effortlessly now.\n\nThe film is always carrying this tragic feeling of \'what if\'. When Caesar talks about his vision, some of these moments are so beautiful they will stick with you. This presents a meta element too, we know Coppola was talking about this movie for decades. It is aiming to capture the process of dreaming, and that is more evocative than anything it can actually show us.\n\nThe film is obviously made by a master director who has seen and done it all before, more Kurosawa\'s Dreams than Southland Tales or Babylon as people keep trying to lump it in with; those were from young directors trying to make a mark and failing big. This one doesn\'t care, it is operating in godseye. This is to a fault, it is so assured that it is challenging us with the meaning of its plot. I almost wanted David Mamet to rewrite the whole thing and give us more meat. But that is not the film.\n\nWe are in a transitional era thrust into various futuristic utopias the billionaires keep planning for us. The film is running parallel about these Elon Musk sorts and their folly comparing them to the fall of Rome, and giving us all these quotes and nuggets to chew on in an almost Oliver Stone fashion, reminding me of his film, Alexander, with its talk about cycles of civilizations rising and collapsing. There are recurring frames like the bitter cousin, the Fishburne narration and the title-cards creating a beautiful rhythm across the film.\n\nWe have seen attempts at this kind of art deco meeting CG style before, and it is never flattering, I am thinking of those awful Atlas Shrugged movies, Great Gatsby, Speed Racer and they always look fake; even if CGI is good, it is never as good as classic films that use practical effects, mattes and models, such as Tim Burton\'s Batman Returns or Coppola\'s own Dracula, both representing the peak of old school methods.\n\nNext, the casting. Paradoxically it has all these millennial clown actors like Aubrey Plaza, Shia LaBeouf, and Jason Schwarztman. While going out its way to cast specifically cancelled actors like Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight. At some moment Coppola is taking direct shots at the zeitgeist (""Of course, everyone prefers women""). The cast is also missing an entire generation, having no Gen X presence in the ensemble, which hurts it, as these who would consist of the bureaucrats and so forth that Driver would be dealing with.\n\nThe script has been in his head for so long, there is no way that it wouldn\'t land. The best thing I can say is that it works. Yet the question lingers how it could have been greater. Still you are getting a real artistic and interesting movie here that is worth a watch. I was also a big fan of Coppola\'s Youth Without Youth which is forgotten today. That movie has a seriousness to it that this film lacks, but it was often dull. Megalopolis could use more of that film\'s cerebral storytelling; between the two of them there is a great movie.', 'This movie reminded me of The Room, and Adam Driver\'s performance was more akin to Tommy Wiseau. Cringe dialogue and bad writing that he could not fake it through. Adam Driver and Nathalie Emmanuel had zero chemistry. Since this was filmed around pandemic times, I\'m wondering if they even met before being cast or were just cast off of zoom. I will bet you now that Adam Driver, Nathalie Emmanuel, and Aubrey Plaza will all get Razzie Award nominations and may even win. I\'ve never seen such a ""talented"" pool of actors lacking such self-awareness as to embarrass themselves and make us question whether they are truly talented. I walked out before the ending because I could not take the bad dialogue, it was like the actors were talking to a wall and had just learned their lines 5 minutes before. That opening Hamlet speech was one of the worst I\'ve ever seen. The cinematography looked like a 2003 made for TV movie edited on Windows 95. This was pretentious, shallow, and a waste of money. It\'s not even so bad it\'s good because I couldn\'t follow the plot because it was all over the place.', ""This may be one of the worst things I have ever watched. It is an incomprehensible mess, a chaotic mélange of multiple ideas that simply do not work together.\n\nIt feels like someone has taken every idea they had for different versions of the same story, mixed them in a pot, eaten the results and then excreted pages of words they stapled together to form an approximation of a script.\n\nI can in all honesty say that I will never watch this again. Coppola is regarded as one of Hollywood's greatest directors. This cannot be his legacy to film. For him to be remembered for this would be an insult to every great movie he has ever made.\n\nOverall? It's bad. The only thing I can say that it made me want was to see Adam Driver on stage doing Shakespeare. That's it. That's the only positive I have about this. 1/5 seems overly generous... #Rome #francissfordcopppla."", 'Is ""Megalopolis"" a masterpiece? Perhaps not, but it did work for me as a film, and I would definitely watch it again. Loosely based on the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC Rome, ""Megalopolis"" features characters based in part on figures of Roman history.\n\nAdam Driver plays Cesar Catilina, a visionary architect who wants to transform ""New Rome"" (New York City) into the city of the future, using a miracle building material he created, Megalon. The parallels to tech bros like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs should certainly not be lost on us.\n\nCesar\'s chief opponent, Mayor Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito) is a good man who lacks Cesar\'s vision, and who believes Cesar is a reckless, arrogant dreamer, whose vision of ""creative destruction"" will have dire consequences for the ordinary people who live in New Rome.\n\nInto the mix Coppola throws Cesar\'s uncle, a Donald Trump- or Rupert Murdoch-type banker, Hamilton Crassus, III (Jon Voight), Clodio Pulcher (Shia LaBeouf), a jealous cousin of Cesar\'s with a gift for rabble rousing, Wow Platinum (Aubrey Plaza), an ambitious financial reporter with designs on both Cesar\'s affections and Crassus\'s fortune, Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel), Mayor Cicero\'s daughter and Cesar\'s potential love interest, and Laurence Fishburne (Fundi Romaine), Cesar\'s driver and the narrator of the film.\n\n""Megalopolis"" is not a realistic movie, and it doesn\'t try to be. Partly inspired by Fritz Lang\'s silent masterpiece, ""Metropolis,"" and also by Ayn Rand\'s novel, ""The Fountainhead,"" with science fiction and surrealist elements, Francis Ford Coppola has been trying to make this film for almost 40 years, and it is essentially an arthouse film with a limited budget, at least by 2024 standards.\n\nIn the end, Coppola financed ""Megalopolis"" with $120 million dollars of his own money, which he got from selling off part of his winery and resorts. This is not the first time he has risked everything to try and realize his artistic vision. While very few people are as privileged as Coppola, I admire his willingness to risk so much to communicate his vision, however imperfect.\n\nAs this might be the 85-year-old filmmaker\'s last film, and as he is probably our most operatic filmmaker, I found his thoughts about the parallels between ancient Rome and 21st Century America to be worthwhile, even though they were somewhat jumbled and unclear at times.\n\nAlthough he holds out hope that artists will save humanity, in the end, I don\'t think Coppola is able to descend from his privileged position to understand that no one will save us if we don\'t act to save ourselves. Artists might be able to hold up a mirror, but in the end, they are not our saviors. We are.\n\nDisclaimer: I am aware that there are allegations of inappropriate touching by Coppola towards some of the female cast and extras during the production, and that there is currently a civil lawsuit pending against him by Lauren Pagone.\n\nAnd there was also some controversy regarding his hiring of ""canceled"" actors, including Shia LaBeouf and Jon Voight for the production. While I was not aware of these allegations before I saw the film, I understand that many people might not want to see the film once they are aware of these facts. Caveat Emptor.', ""Spoiler: the roman empire fell.\n\nAnd so did this movie.\n\nCoppola wants to tell us something, but after 140 min we're not sure what. The themes (yes, plural, they are way too many) are actually interesting: creation/destruction, utopia, leaders, democracy, moral corruption, future, civilizations... all great subjects. But somehow they fail to materialise in a coherent story. Or at least storytelling. It starts off very shallow, with abysmal dialogue and characters we don't care about. How do you make Aubrey Plaza one dimensional?\n\nThe whole cast is criminally underused. Adam Driver is not bad, but this could have been something big. A lot of missed opportunities here. Don't even get me started on LaBeouf.\n\nOnly person who manages to add some forte is the mesmerising Kathryn Hunter. She is so captivating.\n\nStrangely there were scenes, which looked and felt like were directed by someone who just started film school. I was left baffled how this is a Coppola film. Also I personally didn't like a lot of the stylistic choices: music that sounded like my uncle had forgotten the radio on. Costumes which looked like stolen from Babylon. And don't even get me started on Jon Voights arrows.\n\nWhat I liked was the vision and creation of the new city towards the end. Visually it was fantastic. Inbetween the old something new emerged, but somehow intertwined. More of that please.\n\nIn the end, this movie has big goals but unfortunately fails to achieve them. It's a dull, not engaging and all over the place. It's failing right in front of your eyes. So in a way...he did nail that roman empire feeling..."", ""Wow... this is why I love going to the movies.\n\nI just caught *Megalopolis* in IMAX, and I'm still buzzing. The film's scale and vision were so magnified that it felt like I was truly immersed in Coppola's futuristic New York. Every detail was striking, and the whole experience was incredibly powerful.\n\nCoppola funding this $120 million project mostly out of his own pocket is a bold move that reminds me of the golden age of cinema. It's a huge contrast to today's industry, where taking risks often takes a backseat. This daring choice reflects Coppola's commitment to pushing boundaries and crafting complex, unconventional narratives.\n\nDespite the production hurdles budget issues and creative disputes Coppola's determination has resulted in a visually stunning and thought-provoking film. Megalopolis isn't just another movie, it's a stand against the cookie-cutter approach of modern cinema, championing artistic integrity in a world increasingly driven by formulaic blockbusters.\n\nIt might not cater to mainstream tastes, but this film is a powerful testament to the value of artistic risk-taking. It's a film that deserves to be seen, discussed, and remembered, much like Coppola's other classics. In an era where creativity often takes a backseat to profit, *Megalopolis* is a refreshing reminder that the old masters like Coppola are still here, still fighting for the soul of cinema."", 'Someday there will be a BluRay version of this movie with all the scenes that were left on the editing room floor pasted back in with a special audio track with our splendid director, Francis Ford Coppola (FFC) explaining the finer points of the plot and what each scene was supposed to be telling us.\n\nUntil that fine day, those of us who paid admission and sat in theaters experiencing great doses of WTF-wonder will have to sit at home in WTF-wonder trying to make sense of it all. You will certainly wonder what this movie was about for days and days.\n\nI am greatly in favor of niche cinema and self-funding of movies. However this one deserves all of the WTF reviews.\n\nSo should you buy a full price ticket (or economy day ticket)? I say yes. It will be a nice gift to FFC and YOU will get something to think about for days and days.', ""I cannot begin to express my concern for this movie any other than simplify saying...I don't know what the fu!k this movie was about. Thought Adam Driver character ability to freeze the world was cool at first, then came Giancarlo Esposito city meeting scene and then Shia fashion show scene and by that time I was drastically confused, bored, tired of all their over acting, and complete catastrophe of misanthropy (for the movie of course). So this gets 0 stars if I could but unfortunately we can only give 1 stars...for now. Its best he stick to what he knows best TGF nothing else (maybe the Great Gatsby)."", ""The only movie I have ever walked out of\n\nIt is hard to fathom how bad this was\n\nWhere to even begin... It is is almost impressive how you could get such an amazing collection of actors all with some of the top agents Hollywood to read through this script and not realise that was an absolute nonsense\n\nId say it's a waste of 240 minutes but I only made it through 45!!!\n\nA waste of time like no other. If someone was to tell you that the same person directed The Godfather you would call them a bare faced liar\n\nDo not waste your time or money.\n\nLife's too short.\n\nThe only positive was we went home and watched the original Beetlejuice instead."", ""From legendary director Francis Ford Coppola comes Megalopolis, one of the most baffling movies I have ever seen.\n\nSo Megalopolis takes place in New Rome, which is basically a modern day New York City, BUT it operates sort of like Ancient Rome. Cesar Catalina (Adam Drive) is a sort of movie version of a techno billionaire and architect and runs something called the Design Authortity. He can stop time and has invented or discovered a material (element) called Megalon that can do......stuff.....anything.....kind of in a way. Cesar has visions of transforming the city into a technological utopia for everyone. His antagonist is Mayor Cisero played by Giancarlo Esposito who wishes to prevent Cesar from transforming the city because he wants ....casinos? I think.\n\nSo Megalopolis makes NO SENSE whatsoever, there is a plot in only the loosest of terms, some of the performances, mainly Shia Laboeff seems to have no idea what he's doing here, while some of the performances by Driver, Nathalie Emmanuel and Aubrey Plaza are stunning to look at, if not confounding.\n\nThe movie is a marvel to behold but it's schizophrenic and baffling nature make the plot all but impossible to follow as certain story points and characters are abandoned and then suddenly re-emerge later in the movie.\n\nI would say if you have a chance to see it on the big screen somewhere, then do it, if you wait until it hits home video, I don't think it will work or make any sort of impact."", ""Apparently the modern audience of 2024 doesn't get the plot. That's sad because it's quite easy to follow.\n\nDialogue is great and I can hear Coppola's voice when the characters talk.\n\nAlthough he probably won't get an Oscar for best VFX (that green screen scene with the two-by-fours ...) the film is visually stunning and takes you to another world.\n\nThe all star cast is doing a fantastic job and the costumes are amazing.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that the plot doesn't move fast enough and the characters and their actions don't seem motivated enough to get what they want in the story. Also, it didn't feel like the film had a real climax.\n\nOverall, it's a great movie and an enjoyable cinematic experience."", ""You know that you're curious about Francis Ford Coppola's 'Megalopolis'. You read the reviews from professional reviewers - most of whom panned it - but even so, we're all of us anxious to view the results of a horrible accident, even if we have to pay for the privilege.\n\nSo, go ahead, treat yourself. You know you want to.\n\nJust one thing, Don't blame me when you walk out of that theatre; after or during the film's playing.\n\nBecause it's an awful film. Yes, it's gorgeous to look at, even when you have no idea of WHAT you're looking at. Or Why. Or how this scene fits into the story. And speaking of story, there's either (a) none or (b) a story so badly edited that it's impossible to follow, or (c) a story so filled with characters so unlikable that we just don't care.\n\nThere seem to be no stakes in what little story there is. Adam Driver's architect wants to build a new kind of city. Giancarlo Esposito's mayor wants nothing to do with that. Problem is, neither man is a true villain, they simply disagree. Jon Voight's banker holds the money but he too is no real villain. So .... it falls to Shia LaBoeuf to offer some semblance of rooting-against and though he does a great job of it, even he is not detestable. A bunch of sort'a bad people on a one-dimensional stage.\n\nNathalie Emmanuel is fine (as in ravishingly beautiful) as the mayor's daughter and the architect's wife. Aubrey Plaza as the femme fatale is both comedic and ferocious as the gold-digging woman. If there are reasons to see the film (beyond its overall cinematic look) I'd say that the performances of Plaza and LaBoeuf are it.\n\nBut really, You know you don't need a reason. Don't you?"", ""This is the saddest and cringiest movie I have seen in a long time and is the perfect example of what happens when you have reach a level where no one in Hollywood will be critical of your work.\n\nThe tropes are so old and the cliché you have seen all of them 1000 times before. One example, showing lust through young people dancing? Is everyone behind this movie over 200 years old?\n\nThere is no dept it's all first degree and the characters are completely empty.\n\nI'm not even gonna touch the special effects as I don't know how to describe what it is that I saw.\n\nOverall this, for me, feels like what I would expect from a movie written by an AI.\n\nI can't believe that I sat through the entire thing."", ""Taking its lead from a Roman power struggle in 63 BC, Francis Ford Coppola's huge budget Megalopolis might be as much folly as Julius Caesar's retirement plans, but it is as magnificent as the opulence of Rome.\n\nThe story is an unholy mess and suffers from a renegade style of storytelling that is at best disjointed. And yet, in its final half hour, all of the excesses of the previous 90 minutes come to crystal clarity and make perfect sense.\n\nThis is the mark of a master filmmaker and that is Francis Ford Coppola and as this will likely be his last motion picture, it ought to be treated with reverence rather than the scorn that I have seen for it is Coppola's direction and vision that shines most brightly in this piece.\n\nThe acting is campy and over the top and like I said the story is all over the place. But what you see up on the screen is an absolute work of art. Just as the Romans of long ago are dead what is left is the beauty that they've left behind, the art, the architecture, the works of literature and the like. And so it goes with this film - forget about the people - witness the spectacle.\n\nThe acting was good, but there was nothing special. Adam Driver has Cesar Catalia the Nobel prize winning scientist who has created a miracle substance known as megalon (yay for us Godzilla fans) and who can stop time. He wants to transform New Rome (formally New York City - you know, like New Coke) in the near future and is the dire rival of Mayor Frank Cicero, a very Gus Fring-y Giancarlo Esposito who believes that we need to create jobs, have teachers, etc. In the middle of this comes Cicero's med school dropout party daughter Julia played by Nathalie Emmanuel, who takes a job and later becomes lover to Cesar. Shia LaBeouf is probably the most interesting character in the peace as Clodio Pulcher, the grandson of Harrison Crassus III, the richest man in the world. Clodio is unhappy with his life and is unhappy living under the thumb of his grandfather so he stages a palace coup writ large by stirring up the masses against the Mayor so that he can attain the power he so gravely deserves - in his mind\n\nI know a lot has been made about the fact that Coppola said that he hired actors who were not woke because he wanted to be inclusive and such. But in one of the crazier moments he cast pro-Trump advocate, Jon Voight to play a Donald Trump like figure and he does so not very flatteringly. One wonders if Voight was aware of this. Finally, one of the most intriguing actors in the piece was Wow Platinum a society, climbing journalist who is so greedy she marries Hamilton Crassus III for his money. But, despite what I've read about her performance, Plaza was just okay. I expected better. The only actor who delivered a steady performance was Laurence Fishburne who played Cesar's aide de camp and the film's narrator.\n\nWhat excels in Megalopolis are not the people in front of the camera but the people behind the camera and that is chiefly Francis Ford Coppola who wrote, produced and directed the film. The cinematography and production design were absolutely first rate, making a distinctly on location New York City look like New Rome.\n\nIn 1982 he undertook a similar folly and created a love story that took place in a scaled-down version of Las Vegas. Did it work? Well, maybe not in 1982 but nowadays, it is considered a glorious film because it was made from the love of cinema that is sorely lacking in many of the new newer filmmakers at work today.\n\nCoppola is surely old school and yet he has always been a visionary as well. And this film has a couple of subtle nods to his previous films. Like each film in the Godfather trilogy, the movie starts with a big bold brash party and there's a terrific little nod to his war movie in which the poor children are looking at the spectacle of Megalopolis through a chain-link fence, much as the Vietnamese did while watching the Playboy show in Apocalypse now.\n\nFor all its failings and there are many this is a Fable really not of Rome, but of Hollywood and of Coppola's vision that movie making must succeed.\n\nIn this regard, this movie is truly One From Coppola's Heart and it should be watched and re-watched\n\nWATCH IT\n\n3.5/5\n\n(I expect my rating will go up on a second viewing)"", ""Imagine if a utopian fever dream collided head-on with the existential dread of modernity, and the wreckage was sculpted into something shockingly beautiful. That's Megalopolis, a film that feels like the child of Fritz Lang and Stanley Kubrick, nurtured by the chaos of our times. It's not just a movie; it's a symphony of contradictions, where towering ambition meets intimate storytelling.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola, somehow still operating at the peak of his powers, delivers a sprawling epic that dares to ask: What happens when the future we dream of becomes the nightmare we can't escape? The narrative dances on the razor's edge of dystopia and utopia, weaving together tales of architects, rebels, and lovers who are all striving to build something that can withstand the weight of time.\n\nThe visuals are nothing short of hypnotic-a city that never sleeps, bathed in neon and shadow, where every frame feels like it could be hung in a gallery. Coppola's use of light and architecture is masterful, creating a world that is as much a character as the humans who inhabit it. The score, an electronic odyssey, pulses through the veins of the film, pulling you deeper into its labyrinth.\n\nThe performances are just as awe-inspiring. Adam Driver delivers a performance that's both grand and deeply personal, embodying the duality of a man caught between creation and destruction. Nathalie Emmanuel is a revelation, bringing warmth and gravity to a film that could easily have been consumed by its own grandeur.\n\nMegalopolis isn't just a film-it's an experience, one that challenges you to reconsider what cinema can be. It's Coppola's love letter to the future, wrapped in the anxieties of the present, and it's utterly unmissable. A staggering achievement that leaves you breathless, bewildered, and begging for more."", ""At age 85 Francis Ford Coppola decided to send one last message to his audience and I was curious to see what he had to say.\n\nI was taken back a bit by the negative reviews, some of which are justified. The movie does not have a clear storyline, it feels chaotic and occasionally confusing. Despite all of its shortcomings I did like it. The acting is great, the visuals are really good, and while some of the concepts do not make a whole lot of sense, it has a strong point to make.\n\nThe world is a mess and the rich and powerful are exploiting the masses while pretending to be their ally. Is life all about enjoyment or is there more to it? The riches will be gone, but humanity can also be gone if we keep living the way we are. Are there any among the elite who will choose to help the dreamers who want to act for the betterment of humanity?

The script? Was there one? Shia LaBeouf is dreadful. He might be the most overrated, untalented actor ever allowed to choose acting as a profession. The ""script"" is completely cliched by mirroring Ancient Rome with a modern society. That is introductory film school writing. Shame on you, Francis. This was the film you had percolating for over 40 years? It\'s ill advised and lacks logic. I walked out after about eighty-five minutes. I saw this based on Coppola\'s track record. I left asking myself, ""this guy made The Godfather???"" Stay away from this film.', 'This film is incompetent, messy, and ugly.

Changing between each line and making the tone hard to follow and absurd at the best of times and clunky and disgusting at the worst of times. Not to mention the actors, most of which I have enjoyed in other movies all were given terrible delivery and direction. Each stilted and sloppy diatribe only making me want to turn off the movie.\n\nI would give a criticism of the story but by the end of the movie I could barely get a sense on what it was about. The basic synopsis is that it\'s a battle between a futuristic idealism verses modern pragmatism between the industrialist genius and the mayor. One would think this would be expanded and commented on but aside from the first ten and last ten minutes this does not matter. The conflict resolves with a simple ""Hey guys, think about how much the future can be.""\n\nThere are so many small plotline and messy executions that don\'t go anywhere that bloat this disaster of the movie from the set design, weird illusions, magical elements that go nowhere, and odd political illusions. And yet in this mess for moments it gets so terrible= you can\'t help but laugh. Somebody earnestly believed this was a work of art, compelling, and interesting enough for a two hour film, in the utter failure of that sincerity can one find a modicum of enjoyment. However I can not in good faith recommend it, a two hour slop fest for possibly a few dozen minutes laughing at it\'s expense simply isn\'t worth it.', 'This film is beyond awful.

Other times the whole thing seems like an homage to Fritz Lang\'s Metropolis, with more than one message (like ""Between the head and the hand ... etc""), which isn\'t terrible, but the story is hard to follow.

Megalopolis has a problem where it satirizes so many different things simultaneously that it ends up not really saying much of anything as the narrative gets overstuffed with convoluted and outrageous plot points.\n\nThat being said, I do admire how bold and confident Coppola is with his vision, as he tries to make the city of New Rome feel grandiose and dreamlike. Sometimes this works in the movie's favor, as the set design is genuinely breathtaking to look at; but at the same time when Coppola tries to be extremely psychedelic and abstract it ends up being extremely laughable and silly. Another director could probably make a film that follows the exact same story beats and tone down all of the eccentricities and ridiculousness, but that film would end up being much more pedestrian and nowhere near as memorable as how Megalopolis turned out.\n\nWhile I am conflicted about exactly how I feel about Megalopolis, I would still end up recommending you check it out, if nothing more than to experience what a mind so far detached from modern Hollywood sensibilities can present to you on the silver screen."", ""Watched Megalopolis last night.

Everyone is raving about The Substance right now but to me that was just as much of a mess that breaks its own logic constantly and falls apart completely by the end, and almost all scenes were derivative of better horror films.\n\nThis is never going to be up there with Godfather etc but it's still worth seeing in the cinema for its originality, and even toward the end when it gets more abstract it keeps the brain working. I do think it will get re-analysed and appreciated more after the mainstream media have finished with it. Coppola knows all of this of course. This is the swansong he wanted to make before he shuffles off and wont give an F what the initial response is or what the box office take is."", ""I have only ever walked out of a film twice before this one! Endured an hour then me and the missus had to go, shame as we made up double the numbers in the IMAX!?\n\nThis is by far the worst narrative I have seen on the big screen, nothing made sense to me (like to think I am not a thicko). No storyline, characters you simply didn't care about, just seemed to be many different snippets put together and that maketh the toilet on the big screen?!\n\nSave your money and time and avoid this one, use your lifeforce for something more exciting like painting that garden fence that needs doing or mowing the lawn just one more time before winter sets in..."", 'I watched this tonight at the small theatre where I work ocassionally selling tickets and popcorn. As I had a shift tonight I watched it. The only reason I stayed to watch the whole movie was because after the movie it is my responsibility to open the doors for the audience and tell them to have good night.\n\nActually, what I really wanted to do was to apologize them for allowing them to pay for the ticket. There where total 5 visitors. 2 of them left mid-time.\n\nThis movie is so pretentious. So boring. So not epic. Such waste of the talent of great actors. And it will be a waste of your time if you watch it. Trust the critics on this one!', 'Megalopolis is a cinematic tour de force that unflinchingly dissects the precarious state of contemporary American democracy through a chilling parallel with the fall of the Roman Empire. Directed with audacious vision, the film\'s chaotic narrative structure mirrors the tumultuous reality it seeks to critique, deftly illustrating how systemic instability can erode even the most resilient of republics.\n\nThe screenplay navigates a labyrinth of political intrigue, social unrest, and ideological extremism, echoing the historical disintegration that befell Rome. This intentional disorder in storytelling serves as a profound metaphor for the modern world\'s volatile dynamics, underscoring the fragility of democratic institutions in the face of rising neo-fascism and pervasive disinformation.\n\nCinematographically, ""Megalopolis is a masterclass in visual storytelling. The stark, fragmented scenes reflect a society on the brink, evoking a visceral sense of urgency and despair. The performances are universally compelling, with the ensemble cast delivering nuanced portrayals that capture the multifaceted threats to democratic governance.\n\nIn an era where the specter of authoritarianism looms large, Megalopolis is not just a film but a prescient warning. It implores us to heed the lessons of history and remain vigilant, lest we witness the collapse of our own democratic ideals.\n\nThis film is an intellectual triumph, demanding reflection and action from its audience.', ""Francis Ford Coppola's Megalopolis had the potential to be a modern masterpiece, but unfortunately, it falls short in several key areas. The story, while ambitious, feels overly complicated and fails to create a connection with the audience. Instead of a gripping narrative, we're given a plot that seems to be trying too hard to be profound, ultimately losing its emotional impact.\n\nVisually, the film is undeniably colorful, but the heavy reliance on green screen effects is distracting. It's hard to fully immerse yourself in the world of Megalopolis when every scene feels artificial. The constant barrage of vibrant, flashy visuals starts to feel like it's catering to an audience with a short attention span, rather than serving the story in a meaningful way.\n\nThe performances are also hit-or-miss. Adam Driver stands out with a solid portrayal, and it was a pleasure to see talented actors like Giancarlo Esposito, Laurence Fishburne, Dustin Hoffman, and Shia LaBeouf on screen. However, not every performance was as compelling; the supporting female character was unfortunately miscast. Her performance felt stiff and uninspired, which detracted from the film's overall quality. This imbalance in the cast made it harder to stay invested in the story.\n\nUltimately, Megalopolis aims to be a thought-provoking and visually stunning film, but it ends up feeling shallow and over-produced. While I wasn't bored, I found myself eagerly awaiting the film's conclusion."", ""Even knowing the situation regarding the bad reviews from critics, I prepared myself to see Megalopolis trusting in the vision of an acclaimed and beloved Francis Ford Coppola, but I think it doesn't make us any less cinephiles or fans of his other works to admit that this is, frankly, a very bad movie.\n\nThe main problem with Megalopolis is that it wants to be bigger than the product itself allows. It's too complex a concept to be approached with complete levity. The director expects that in his overly bombastic script, we'll learn everything that happens in this great city, with its extravagant personalities, in a frenetic ten minutes.\n\nThe film thus starts off on the wrong foot, but what follows does not bring with it improvements, but rather more and more decadence. Without going into details or spoilers, an interesting and exotic cinematography with a cast that would give something to talk about is discarded for a poorly made script."", ""My wife and I watched Megalopolis (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline takes place in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic city called New Rome, where two wealthy families-the Cicero family, led by the traditionalist mayor, and the Caesar family, who possess unique artistic and architectural abilities-are at odds. The mayor's daughter is in love with the young, rising star of the Caesar family and seeks to bridge the gap between the two worlds, though the men in power are resistant to change.\n\nThis film, written and directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather) features an incredible cast, including Adam Driver (Ferrari), Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad), Jon Voight (Anaconda), Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix), Dustin Hoffman (Rain Man), Talia Shire (Rocky), Aubrey Plaza (White Lotus), Shia LaBeouf (Transformers), and Nathalie Emmanuel (Game of Thrones).\n\nDespite having all the elements to be a masterpiece-an outstanding cast, stunning cinematography, creative costume design, excellent lighting, and top-tier CGI-the writing was overly ambitious, and some performances felt miscast and awkward. Specifically, Adam Driver and Shia LaBeouf were poorly suited for their roles, with Driver's performance coming across as especially weak. It felt like a younger DiCaprio would have been a better fit for Driver's character, and LaBeouf's role seemed unnecessary altogether. This is a major issue because the film hinges on Driver's performance, which unfortunately falls flat.\n\nOn the other hand, Giancarlo Esposito and Jon Voight delivered standout performances, but even their brilliance couldn't save a plot that's disjointed, awkward, and full of forced technological and innovative elements that don't work. The world Coppola creates is vast and visually impressive, but it isn't enough to compensate for the film's awkward pacing and inconceivable storyline.\n\nIn the end, it's truly disappointing that with all these resources and such a talented cast, this is what Coppola delivered. I'd give it a 2/10 and recommend skipping it."", ""Megalopolis is a bold swing but completely misses the mark. Starring a talented yet wasted cast of Adam Driver, Nathalie Emmanuel, Shia LaBeouf, Aubrey Plaza, Laurence Fishburne, and more.\n\nThough this review is very negative, I did think that Shia LaBeouf's performance was entertaining. He was definitely the only actor besides Laurence Fishburne that truly lived into his role. He has a very natural blend of odd charisma, comedy, and mischief that stays true to the character.\n\nOutside of that, there's some nice imagery in here with stunning neon-lit shots in the rain, crumbling statues, and large shadows being cast on skyscrapers.\n\nUnfortunately, everything else feels aimless and confused. The performances in this film come off as awkward and wooden, further hindered by odd dialogue that is needlessly superfluous in an attempt to sound intelligent. It seems like none of the actors understood the film or their characters.\n\nOn a story level, there's so much going on here that the film becomes packed to the brim with ludicrous subplots that go nowhere. Many sequences don't flow into the next and there seems to be a lot of footage missing while other scenes go on for far too long. I felt like I was in the theater for twice the runtime. I won't spoilt it but there is an odd ten-minute drug induced scene that is absolute insanity that I couldn't help but laugh.\n\nMegalopolis is ultimately a story between cynicism and idealism. The film favors an idealistic outlook on the future of a crumbling society likened to America yet for being so preachy, there aren't any innovative solutions presented. Maybe that's the point and instead Coppola is inviting the audience to ponder resolutions to the world's problems.\n\nI unfortunately cannot recommend Megalopolis to anyone as it is an incomprehensible mess that feels like it was directed by a bunch of different people."", ""What might you get if you mix elements of science fiction, art film, ideologies, philosophies, ancient Roman history, crystallomancy, time suspension, hallucinogenics and references to iconic moments in movies and news? 'Megalopolis' is one possibility.\n\nA movie that doesn't quite work as a whole. Includes some interesting thoughts, ideas and visuals. It's arty leaning may see it becoming a cult classic at some point, but I'm not in a hurry for a re-watch. It does have obvious political leanings. Coppola's best science fiction?..... his only, as far as I know. It may be more attractive to a younger audience looking for something different, a little wacky, and who haven't had much exposure to some of the debates, symbolism, philosophies, ideologies it touches on.\n\nBasically, it promotes that a creative, visionary, benevolent dictator, who's found love despite his reptilian mother, is the best option for the design and leadership of a 'new world'. Someone who incorporates the best of left and right wing ideologies. As opposed to either, 1. A populist, slanderous, corruptible, degenerate, that would only use majority rules voting as a means of obtaining leadership power, rather than championing voting as a human right. Or, 2. An inflexible 'realist', Mayor/Prosecutor, that believes maintaining the status quo is the only realistic option for future planning. Whom is also comfortable with casting false accusations to maintain his position of power. Additionally, the movie promotes that massive philanthropy of the super wealthy, in supporting, presumably, a confirmed benevolent visionary dictator (Cesar), is necessary for this Utopia to succeed."", 'As I sit in my reclining office chair, reflecting on how I feel about this film. I smile because this is, in my opinion, the type of thoughts and feelings true film and cinema should invoke.\n\nI believe in a time when cinema was a place where audiences came NOT to just be entertained but to possibly be challenged to reflect and to think. Or perhaps this is just an idea or dream of mine. In today\'s modern world, audiences have become more passive in their viewing of movies, and where movies have become mindless Francis Ford Coppola\'s Megalopolis is, in a word, a breath of fresh air.\n\nNonetheless, with that said, let\'s get honest...\n\nMegalopolis is a mess. Though I enjoyed Coppola\'s ideas and artistic vision for this film, and while there is merit in certain regards, it is, I think, rather botched in its execution.\n\nCoppola builds a film that requires a lot of thought and perhaps even persistence on the viewer\'s part, unfortunately, though, even if a viewer is willing to, they are not rewarded with much.\n\nSet in the backdrop of New Rome (or modern-day New York), the story here is very reminiscent of old film epics and Roman tragedies by William Shakespeare, and these themes can be aesthetically pleasing, yet it doesn\'t completely work as a storytelling method or at least was poorly executed.\n\nThe dialogue is atrocious (but at times can be rather profound); however, those times are few. The music can also be just as confusing though it does its job at invoking the feel of Rome as those old epics did.\n\nOverall, like Joker, I think there\'s a lot that could be said both for this film\'s merit and its shortcomings, and while I desperately wanted to be in the minority who loved Megalopolis, it is just too much of a mess.\n\nRegardless of whatever anyone may think of this film, I think that in this mess, Coppola says a lot more than most ""Hollywood"" films would bother or even care to do, and for that, I can still say good job, Mr. Coppola. I appreciate the effort.\n\nFinal Score: 4/10.', ""Megalopolis is a visual spectacle that delivers a powerful globalist message, intertwining the Green Movement with themes of transhumanism as a leap into the unknown, portraying it as an ultimate act of freedom. The film's use of heavy symbolism glorifies this perspective, while twisting traditional archetypes to offer a 180-degree reinterpretation. The narrative subtly manipulates viewers to sympathize with a globalist moral high ground, presenting traditional societal evolution as outdated. Its cinematic ambition and layered allegories make it a provocative reflection on a Yuval Noah Harari future of humanity."", ""There was a vision, but I don't know how well executed it was. Not a lot of story development or character development, more like things happening one after another without leading to anything. Concept was interesting. The casting was mostly alright but not really the best, I was needing a more dynamic performance for the journalist character, she could have done a lot but was lost with what was planned for her storyline. The time control thing also did nothing, what was it there for? Could have been interesting to see how someone weaving that type of power would influence the happenings in that sort of world."", ""This is going to go over most people's heads and I'm astonished that this film got the green light as I cannot see it ever making its money back, but the messages in this film are amazing, it talks about the way out civilisation is replicating much of what the last years of the Roman empire went through, with the debt, the gluttony of the rich and powerful while civilisation around them was falling apart. It's talks about how there is an alternative way and the fact we are not destined to do what has happened before, there's Stoicism and the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius, there's so much more, much of which was over my head. Anybody who wants to see a John Wick flick will not enjoy this, but if you want to watch something of a higher level, then this could be a truly worth while film for you."", ""Did Coppola deliver his magnum opus with this one? Definitely not. Is it a disaster? Far from it.\n\nThere's a middle ground and I'm trying to represente it.\n\nForty years of ideas, development and fine-tuning crammed into 138 minutes - it's bound to feel overwhelming, and to be honest, it does. Some scenes are visually stunning, while others fall flat. Certain monologues hit with real emotional weight, while others come off as hollow. The narrative sometimes flows, and at other times, it feels like disjointed sequences strung together. The ending is more upbeat than I expected, although I'm not convinced it fully aligns with the project's overall message.\n\nI've never been a fan of Adam Driver, but his performance (along with most of the cast) is solid, at the very least.\n\nIt's tough to form a definitive opinion after just one viewing, perhaps my only viewing, but I understand why reactions to this are so divided. If I'm forced to lean one way, I'd say it lands somewhere between good and bad, but ultimately, it's not great."", 'Not sure what Coppola had in mind when he chose a crew of low-end novices. Maybe saving every penny on rookie crew. This abomination of a movie is lite so badly that a high-school film student would have failed the course. Lighting, camera work, wardrobe are absolutely horrible even for amateur film makers like Coppola collected. And th sets - one could get better sets at community college ub Tijuana. The story sucks ( is there a story?) !! The dialog ( if you can call the gibberish shove into the actors mouths is that) is pathetic/ shame!! We are talking about Coppola - not Roger Corman. What a waste !!', ""If Megalopolis had been released in the 70s or 80s, it might have been celebrated as a classic abstract film. However, in its current form, the concept and execution feel dated.\n\nHere's what didn't work for me. Visually, the film is inconsistent and poorly executed. The color grading is subpar, and the shots lack cohesion. Some CGI scenes are impressive, while others are downright awful. Certain sequences manage to captivate, only to be followed by bland, uninspired ones that pull you out of the experience. It felt like watching several disjointed films stitched together, making the visual journey tedious.\n\nI wish the film had leaned into a more abstract aesthetic, perhaps drawing inspiration from Art Deco or a Gothic style. Instead, we got uninspired set pieces that, despite decent performances, failed to immerse me in the story. That said, there are a few standout scenes that I genuinely enjoyed and found well-crafted.\n\nAs for the story, it's surprisingly straightforward, despite the dialogue's attempts to inject deeper meaning. The overly dramatic, campy dialogue often fell flat, and some performances came across as unintentionally silly, leaving little emotional impact.\n\nWhile the metaphors are decent, they aren't compelling enough to make the film resonate in today's context. If this had been released decades ago, it might have received more acclaim, but as it stands, it feels like a relic of another era.""]",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/megalopolis/7058fa1a-a01d-4ffa-96c0-a9c89b828669.webp

There are a LOT of them. The casting? Perfect. The acting? Pretty flawless. All performances drew me in and added greatly to the story. The concept was phenomenal and super interesting. A really great idea for a movie. The cinematography was unique and very good. The score also greatly added to the suspense. The first 2 thirds of the movie executed all of these things to a T\n\nSo why 6 stars? THE ENDING. Took the believable and suspenseful story aspects and threw them out the window in favor of indulging the director's Cronenberg fantasy and desire to max out the special effects budget. It came off as completely disorganized, almost like they had no idea what to do with the ending or any desire to make it interesting. A movie with so much going for it and I left the theater disappointed.\n\nSide notes: enough with the butt shots. We get what you're trying to do, that's enough. Also, if you want to disgust your audience, put in the work in the writers room. Adding over the top squelching sounds to almost every scene is lazy."", ""Every scene of this film wowed me at TIFF. The casting, atmosphere, visual and sound design, music, and, of course, the symbolism of it all.\n\nDemi Moore and Margaret Qualley couldn't have been more perfectly cast as leads. Their devotion to the process and trust in their director was clear to me. Their vulnerability pulls this off and leads to a very compelling fever dream.\n\nEveryone involved should be really proud of this film. To me, it's a future cult classic.\n\nIt is body/psychological horror, so don't expect jump scares. It's deeper than that. I found myself getting lost in reflection during the film (as a 47 year old woman it really spoke to me).\n\nBut it's also extremely fun to watch!\n\nTake it seriously as a true work of art, but don't at the same time, and you'll have a blast."", ""Was an enjoyable watch but the last 20-30 minutes got kinda silly and dumb, it lost its intelligence and subtlety too say the least and went to pure dumb gross out scenery, completely unnecessary especially when the messaging wasn't exactly subtle and was evident throughout the entire movie, from the very premise itself tbh, point is they could a ended on a much stronger note before the final change as it added nothing too what it was trying to say or show, not that it should turn anyone off from watching it, it's a good movie that will keep you interested from start too finish but should've been 20 min shorter."", ""And I've seen thousands. I estimate about 5k movies in my 39 years on this earth. I can't remember one ever hitting me this hard. I was sweating when it finished, even in a cool auditorium. Words to describe how I feel (until now, a full hour after): shocked, floored, stuck, traumatized (in a good way?). This movie affected me. It destroyed me.\n\nAs soon as the credits rolled, everyone in the theater started talking to each other, saying things like wow, omg, wth, BRO, while laughing in shock. These are random people I don't know. We continued to discuss it afterwards. That's never happened to me before.\n\nDon't watch this movie if the following apply to you: You are squeamish, sensitive, or easily triggered. You don't know what body horror is. You're not familiar with dark comedies. You close your eyes at scary parts. You are looking for a date movie.\n\nIf the following apply to you, go see this now, without watching a trailer or reading what it's about: You are fully desensitized. You're annoyed with all the neutered PG-13 movies. You even think modern R-rated movies are too mild and don't go all out. You feel like movies are all the same or fail to stand out.\n\nThe acting is great, with Demi Moore possibly giving her best performance. All technical aspects are pristine, with the sound design/mixing standing out the most. If the director wants you to hear someone chewing obnoxiously, it will sound like the mic is in his mouth. Like the rest of the movie, everything is in your face in an intentionally off-putting way.\n\nAbout halfway through, I was really enjoying it, but I was worried that it would go the way of many style-over-substance movies. They rarely land for me because I need more than metaphors and deeper meanings. The Substance has those things, but still comes through with one of the most satisfying third acts I can think of.\n\nI rarely ever give 10 star ratings (excluding comedies, 13 ever). And rewatchability plays a big factor. I don't care. Even if I only watch this a couple more times, I will NEVER forget this experience, or the images that are seared into my brain forever.\n\n(2 viewings, early access screening 9/18/2024, 10/30/2024)"", 'This is a desperately overrated film. It\'s an interesting watch, for sure, but as a whole it falls flat. While the director utilizes artistry for the story, ultimately the plot holes are undeniable, and worst of all, the ending is just ridiculous to the point where everything good that they were selling for the first hour about it devolves into a mess of a movie.\n\nHave you ever heard of the term \'reaching\'? That is what the people praising this are doing. They are reaching because in the first hour of the film, the movie showed promise, and they are ignoring everything that came after, which is plot holes galore.\n\nAlso, spiritually, it is a negative movie experience. The energy is negative and pointless by the end. There are no moral lessons here of which should have been if they stuck with the depth and substance of the first hour of a woman trying to regain her youth. Instead, it just devolves into a vapid gore fest in the third act that is just meant to stir up publicity and cause shock.\n\nThe first hour was pretty decent, but if this is what passes as a ""good movie"" or a ""classic"" these days as many reviews are trying to push, then we are in trouble. It has those very few elements at times of a masterpiece like many movies that try to push boundaries do, but ultimately it\'s a bad movie that doesn\'t even come close to a Wes Craven Scream film, and those aren\'t even masterpieces.\n\nWe need to cut down the hyperbole these days. Being different is not enough to be a masterpiece, and I feel bad for people who think this is anything great. They must have only seen twenty films in their lifetimes.', 'I was extremely hyped for that movie even though I\'m not a big fan of Fargeat\'s debut film ""Revenge"". I liked her as a director, but not as a screenwriter. While that movie had interesting visual style, the screenplay was bad & stupid and the characters were uninteresting.\n\nHowever she improved a lot from her last movie. ""The Substance"" looks amazing, the shots, the score, the editing, production design and even costumes are well thought out. The screenplay is also great (she actually won an award for Best Screenplay at Cannes for ""The Substance""), the decisions that characters are making are understandable - they are results from characters\' determination to achieve their goals.\n\nI also loved Demi Moore\'s perfomance (it\'s worth mentioning that I wasn\'t considering her good actress at all, but after watching that movie, the first thought that came to my mind was that maybe she isn\'t a bad actress, she was just starring in bad movies), it\'s definitely highlight of her carrer. Margaret Qualley is great as always. Even Dennis Quaid, despite little screen time, gives fun and engaging perfomance.\n\nProbably the most talked about part of that movie is gore and body horror elements. And, yeah, I must admit that this movie is pretty extreme and may be hard to watch for some viewers. Personally during those scenes I wasn\'t feeling disgusted or smth, cause I\'m a big fan of disturbing cinema, so I\'m used to that stuff, but I understand that it may be a hard journey for others. That proves how great make-up artist did their job (i would be happy seeing this movie nominated for an Oscar for ""best make-up and hairstyling) and how sick and twisted Fargeat\'s imagination is.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend this movie. It may not be for everyone, but it\'s worth checking out for yourself and seeing it for yourself, cause even if u don\'t like it, u can\'t deny is isn\'t one of the most insane, extreme and interesting movie of this year (or even a decade).', ""The substance reproduces the things that it wants to criticize.\n\nThe criticism doesn't work because it's contradictory. It wants to criticize the beauty cult but reproduces the fear and disgust of aging. It shows us a tremendously disgusting old female body and places it next to a younger, thinner and wrinkle-free version. With a male gaze all over it.\n\nThe Substance shows us that the worst thing that can happen to a woman is getting old. If she's old, she's worthless, ugly and unloveable. So you have to do anything to stay young, thin and beautiful.\n\nInstead of criticising the system and the society, who are responsable for this beauty cult, the movie emphasizes, how greedy and envious the female protagonist is."", 'In 2017, Coralie Fargeat\'s directorial debut \'Revenge\' was released. A subversive tale of vengeance, like \'Kill Bill\' mixed with \'Wolf Creek,\' it was greeted with overwhelming praise, going on to make just under a million dollars at the box office. A strikingly shot picture overflowing with thematic weight, it showed Fargeat as a filmmaker unafraid to push boundaries and challenge conventions; a visionary with bold ideas.\n\nA notion compounded by her second feature \'The Substance\'. A satirical body-horror, it centres on Elisabeth Sparkle, a fading Hollywood starlet. After her 50th birthday, she is fired from her job as host of an aerobics show; her producer reasoning she is past her prime. Circumstances introduce Sparkle to a new wonder drug, creating a younger, more beautiful and perfect version of herself- if she follows the instructions, that is.\n\n\'The Substance\' is a wild film, most easily described as being like \'All About Eve,\' or \'Sunset Boulevard,\' if directed by David Cronenberg. It contains much thematic depth, perhaps most obviously about fame, objectification and the ridiculous beauty standards faced by females in Hollywood. Fargeat\'s screenplay delves into the perils of a society obsessed with youth and perfection, showcasing the lengths to which individuals are willing to go to, to maintain their relevance and desirability.\n\nIt is a sad truth that, traditionally, opportunities for actresses dry up after they reach a certain age. Famously, in the early 1960\'s, Bette Davis was having such a hard time finding work that she placed an advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter, offering her services. In it, she stated that she possessed ""thirty years\' experience as an actress in motion pictures"" and was ""mobile still and more affable than rumour would have it."" With her narrative, Fargeat cuttingly satirises the Hollywood machine, as well as the fickleness of fame.\n\nFurthermore, as Sparkle becomes increasingly consumed by the drug and its effects, the film explores the duality of identity and the internal conflict between one\'s true self and the facade presented to the world, echoing Oscar Wilde\'s \'The Picture of Dorian Gray\' and Robert Louis Stevenson\'s \'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\'. Moreover, the grotesque transformations therein serve as a metaphor for the internal and external pressures faced by women in the entertainment industry. Other notions, such as addiction, control and obsession, are also examined; interwoven cleverly into the narrative and explored with tongue firmly in cheek.\n\nIt is a visually arresting film, with Fargeat\'s signature style evident in every frame. Alongside director of photography Benjamin Kracun, her use of vibrant, contrasting colours creates a surreal world for Sparkle to navigate; like some kind of 1980\'s hellscape. Furthermore, canny homages to other filmmakers (including Roman Polanski and Stanley Kubrick) serve to heighten the sinister atmosphere of proceedings, which the use of wide-angle lenses and extreme close-ups compounds. Combined with Gladys Garot and Stanislas Reydellet\'s meticulous production design, as well as Emmanuelle Youchnovski\'s costumes, the visuals are unsettlingly artistic and powerful.\n\nThe sound design is similarly effective at generating a sense of macabre disquiet. Much like the lush visuals, sounds are heightened to have the upmost effect. Moreover, Benjamin Stefanski\'s score is eerie and evocative, generating much dread, while songs like Bernard Hermann\'s \'The Nightmare & Dawn\' from \'Vertigo,\' and \'Pump It Up\' by Earl Gregory are used to particularly strong effect. Furthermore, it is a well-edited picture, moving at a fast pace throughout.\n\nIn addition, the special effects and make-up are disgustingly breathtaking. Much like Rob Bottin\'s incredible work for John Carpenter\'s \'The Thing,\' or Chris Walas and Stephan Dupuis\'s similarly brilliant efforts for Cronenberg\'s \'The Fly,\' Pierre-Olivier Persin\'s mostly practical effects are jaw-dropping. In the latter half in particular, they are on full display, and are never anything less than bloody amazing.\n\nDemi Moore stars as Sparkle, and is startlingly intense. She goes all out, holding nothing back- both literally and metaphorically. There are parallels between herself and the character of Sparkle, which serve only to heighten the impact of the narrative and the power of her performance. ""Fearless"" and ""brave"" are words often applied to actors, and are usually inaccurate overstatements- they\'re only acting, after all, not firefighting. However, they are probably the best terms to describe Moore\'s work in the film. It\'s a gutsy performance devoid of vanity, that may be her best so far.\n\nMargaret Qualley does similarly powerful work as Sue, Sparkle\'s alter-ego. Much like Moore, she gives everything to the role, and is equally compelling. She brings a vibrant energy and unsettling allure to proceedings, making her character sinisterly beguiling, and the film all the more gripping for it. In addition, Dennis Quaid- in a role originally meant for the late, great Ray Liotta- is magnificently manic as Sparkle\'s producer; clearly having a ball with the material.\n\nIn conclusion, \'The Substance\' is a thought-provoking and visually arresting film that solidifies Coralie Fargeat\'s reputation as a bold and innovative filmmaker. By blending satirical commentary with visceral horror, Fargeat crafts a narrative that is as entertaining as it is unsettling, making the film a must-watch for fans of body horror and incisive social commentary alike. Boasting strong performances and incredible special effects, it fires on all cylinders and doesn\'t disappoint. So, buy the ticket and take the ride, because \'The Substance\' is a trip worth taking.', ""We live in an amazing time. After seeing a film with a score of 8, and even with 2 famous actresses, and even with a woman director, whom I had never heard of before, and even in the horror genre, and even in the body horror subgenre.\n\nWow! I told myself and immediately turned on the inflated ratings, waiting, not yet knowing why.\n\nI won't hide it for long. That's exactly what happened.\n\nThe subgenre itself is very niche. Well, judge for yourself: open fractures, blood, intestines. The human body is mutating into something absolutely disgusting. By the way, it is not always only the human body that gets in this format.\n\nAs a subgenre, why not, but it has never been massive, but this film...\n\nThe film's wrapper is very attractive. An incomprehensible description and a bright, beautiful, dynamic trailer. You can understand what is depicted there only after viewing, so if the viewer has not familiarized himself with the genre on the profile resource, he will most likely be unpleasantly surprised.\n\nBut the ratings are high, so the audience was lured by the picture, they slipped an absolute abomination. By the standards of modern sleek mass cinema, that's for sure. And the viewer was satisfied?\n\nI would bet that the viewer was just shocked + the film has a message and some kind of morality, so positive ratings still prevail.\n\nBut I, as a person for whom this genre has existed for 40 years, was satisfied only because of the acting and very cool makeup. They really molded this something at the end out of I don't even want to guess what.\n\nBut if you delve into the plot, the behavior of the characters sometimes, then the picture begins to float.\n\nThe fact that all men are goats, objectification of women is bad and that chasing beauty at the sacrifice of health is bad, I realized in the first 15 minutes. Why do I need 2 more hours?\n\nYes, the camera hitting the interesting places of women is cool done, but I did not come to an adult film.\n\nThe ending is so-so. The scene in the hall is deliberately slipping into trash. You understand that, so it was and it was. It feels like the film deliberately tried to be something sublime and about meaning until the last moment, so as to surprise so much in the end. It surprised me wonderfully.\n\nIt's a shame for the line with the classmate of the main character. It gets its logical conclusion, but in the middle of the film I thought that the authors would go away, but this is already subjective.\n\nObjectively, if you evaluate and compare with others, not even the best representatives of the genre. This movie is just average. But it must be borne in mind that for a film like this, a score of 7 is already a wow success. For understanding, The Thing film has a score of 8.2, and after it there are films of the 30s and only after that the films of Cronenberg begin.\n\nJust so you understand. If the score of a horror story is from 7 points, then this is already a masterpiece, but here ... 8 ... I do not understand. I'm blocking it."", ""This is one of those movies that would not do justice seeing at home. You need to be in a packed theater, feel the waves and rushes of energy from the crowd. It's is an experience to say the least. You will laugh, you will look away, your jaw will drop, you will feel uncomfortable. But it's all worth it. It's incredible filmmaking, award winning acting and a smashing soundtrack all in one. Huge applause to Demi for taking on such a vulnerable role covering a subject that is rarely discussed. Looking forward to see what comes of this, hopefully more open conversation within the industry and more doors opened than closed.\n\nJust note, this is NOT a movie you want to get high before seeing."", ""Demi Moore plays Elisabeth Sparkle, a celebrity who became famous when she was young and beautiful. Now she's older (but in good shape) and we will see what aging does to her career and self-image. With outside help, she creates a younger version of herself called Sue (Margaret Qualley), but she is warned that she has to periodically switch between living as the younger and older version of herself. She must not be late to make the switch!\n\nTo make this film they started off with a big bowl of drama, added a teaspoon of sci-fi, and a pinch of mystery. These elements work well together because everything is connected to the main story. At the end they added a whole bucketload of splatter à la early Peter Jackson (only they had a bigger budget and the effects were of course more modern.) This switch doesn't work so well for me.\n\nI think they got the right actors for the parts. Besides Moore and Qualley I should also mention Dennis Quaid as the dirty, old boss. The cinematography was good. It had some weird close-ups, but those added to the mood of those scenes. The film had some body transformation effects that I liked, because it felt like something physical was on the screen. (The eyes were probably digital, however.)\n\nAlthough I think this is in some ways a well-made film, I don't know who to recommend it to. Some will think the first three quarters of the film are interesting and appreciate that it takes its time to tell the story, but they might be put off by the ending. Others will think that the start and middle of the film are too slow and boring and might complain that we don't get any action until the end. I can appreciate different kinds of films, but it's distracting when you take a too sharp turn from one genre to another late in the film. For others it apparently works better, considering that From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) is a cult-classic, while I've always felt that it's two great films that were combined into one decent film.\n\nIf you're not too squeamish, and like strange films with some surprises this might be for you. Maybe."", 'Believe the hype - ""The Substance"" is even better than they say. From the opening scene, this film grabs you with its stunning cinematography and powerhouse performances by Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley. The 2.5-hour runtime flies by, leaving you wishing it would never end. This movie is an instant cult classic, blending a fantastic score with razor-sharp social satire that feels both timely and timeless.\n\nWhat really sets ""The Substance"" apart is its homage to Kubrick, infused with a fresh, female-driven perspective that makes every moment feel uniquely powerful. Coralie Fargeat has crafted a horror experience that\'s exactly what Cronenberg should be doing now-clever, grotesque, and endlessly captivating. Loved it, loved it, loved it.', ""The movie started off with an intriguing premise. Seeing Demi Moore back on the big screen, portraying a character grappling with age-related insecurities, was both refreshing and powerful. Moore, as one of the most stunning and graceful mature actresses I've seen, brought a rawness to the role that really hit home. Her character's struggles with the pressure of maintaining physical beauty in a society obsessed with youth and appearance were deeply relatable, and it felt like the film was setting up to explore these important themes in a thoughtful and impactful way.\n\nAs the plot unfolded, it continued to develop in a promising direction. It took a darker turn, delving into the complexities of self-perception and the destructive obsession with physical perfection. The themes of fractured identity and a lack of self-love were poignant, and for a while, the film seemed to be handling these modern issues effectively. The storyline, touching on the fragmentation of personalities and the psychological consequences of societal pressures, was gripping. I was fully invested in seeing how the narrative would conclude.\n\nHowever, when it came to the ending, it all fell apart. What could have been a profound and thought-provoking conclusion instead devolved into a senseless and, frankly, off-putting sequence that left a bad taste. It felt like all the promise of the earlier parts of the film was undone by a chaotic, incoherent, and ultimately unsatisfying resolution. The ending not only failed to tie up the themes but also undermined the strength of the narrative. It was a great idea, but the execution at the end dragged the entire movie down, leaving me disappointed and questioning what it had all been for."", 'The better version of you is you. Not to be someone else nor someone younger or prettier. I like the message that packed in sarcastic way. At the end of the day, you need to choose, your own beauty or beauty with the monster within. Getting older and not pretty anymore is natural. Getting less famous and attractive is the consequences of life. Be grateful of what you have, and being not satisfy with what we have, only will lead us to the disaster. And remember karma does exist. You plant flowers, you will see the beauty. So, it is worth to watch. You will not see scary thing if you understand the message.', ""Possibly the most vile, grotesque, absurd film I've had the misfortune of watching. I'm glad I got to see it for free in my cinema as I'd be very upset if I had to pay for this. This must be the first screening I've been to where people left halfway through. I highly recommend you avoid this if you dislike needles or blood.\n\nWhile the concept was interesting and had potential, the execution was very poor. The film very much lacked substance and felt very hollow. I wouldn't be surprised if this didn't take very much time to produce. It's quite disappointing that this film passed through multiple layers of boards, people, studios, financing and was approved.\n\nThis is a great film for hollow people with very few thoughts or zero internal monologue, it will appear deep, thoughtful and daring to them."", ""The first two thirds of the movie, with its ingenious premise and building up suspense was handled masterfully. The last third, particularly the ridiculous and needlessly gory ending, totally ruined the movie. It's as if the last third was directed by someone else entirely, clearly someone lacking ideas. The great thing about the movie is you have absolutely no idea what direction it will take, and for the most part this was refreshing.\n\nWhen the movie suddenly descended into cheap stupidity, I lost all connection and interest, leaving me very cheated and disappointed.\n\nSome will conclude that I failed to pick up on the subliminal message. BUT, I think that same would have landed more powerfully, and widely, if it was handled with the same degree of effort most of the movie exhibited.\n\nIt's a shame because for a while, it was near all-time classic levels. Sadly, instead of raving about a rare screen gem, i'd be too embarrassed to recommend this to anyone else.\n\nDemi was good and it was nice to see her back on the screen. However, she could have spared showing us her flat and puckered bum!"", 'I have to admit, with my review of her first film (""Revenge""), I did Madame Fargeat an injustice because at the time I perceived it as a pseudo-feminist rape-revenge thriller with significant logic problems. But now it\'s clear to me: the ""message"" is just the starting point - otherwise she mainly wants to have fun and bring her wonderful style to the people, which I really liked it in her first film. This time it was clear from the start: you don\'t even need to think about suspension of disbelief: the no longer very young television celebrity Elizabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), now lead dancer in a fitness program, is rejected by her producer (Dennis Quaid) because of her age. Then she receives the offer to create a younger version of herself (Margaret Qualley) using the substance referenced in the title. But in order to do this, rules have to be followed and this is becoming increasingly difficult, especially for the younger version - with severe consequences. And that\'s where Fargeat comes into its own - even more so than with ""Revenge"". Body horror at its best, which almost makes Cronenberg, Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna look like beginners. Other horror films are also happily quoted (including The Shining, Carrie and Freaks) without seeming contrived or pandering. On the other hand this film is not scary in any way, even if there are effects that get quite under your skin (I\'m just saying ""spinal cord puncture""), instead there\'s a lot to laugh about because of all the over-the-top action. And huge, huge respect for Demi Moore! It takes a lot of courage to expose yourself and let yourself be portrayed like that!', ""'The Substance (2024)' is style. Subtlety isn't in its vocabulary; it beats you round the head with its each and every aspect. Thanks to some really strong, self-assured direction, cinematography and editing, the picture explodes onto the big screen in a big way and forces itself into your eyeballs whether you like it or not. Its general aesthetic is so full-blooded and colourful that it's impossible not to be wholly swept up by it, an infectious energy seeping from each and every increasingly unhinged frame. It strikes just the right balance of campy and creepy, even if its unwieldy tone occasionally feels a little clumsy. It often comes close to making some fairly profound points and conveying the horror of overwhelming, societally reinforced self-consciousness (a simple yet excellent sequence of cruel self-doubt is one of the most effective in the entire film), but it tends to slip away from these more attainable and straightforwardly relatable moments in favour of its own brand of Grand Guignol excess and blunt-force theming.\n\nThe feature doesn't really say all that much; it arguably only really has one idea, and it's a fairly basic idea at that. It's about what societal beauty standards and the male gaze (which itself was the target of the director's previous feature, 'Revenge (2017)') force women to do to themselves in order to remain 'beautiful', about how the pressure put on women to retain a youthful appearance feeds a cycle of insecurity that leads to self-destruction. However, it explores this familiar theme in a relatively fresh way, doing so with the opposite of nuance - perhaps to hammer the point across so brutally that it's finally understood. It does a good job at showcasing the cycle of self-destruction I mentioned a moment ago; in fact, that cycle - or, maybe, the concept of it - is pretty much the entire picture in microcosm. For Elizabeth (Demi Moore), the picture's superstar protagonist, what starts as a means to an end slowly becomes a dependency. Substance use becomes substance addiction, which in turn becomes substance abuse, which in turn becomes substantially worse for our hero than her inner demons and the sexism of her colleagues ever were. Sue (Margaret Qualley), her other self born out of her back and fueled by her spinal fluid, is younger and perkier and more flexible, the ideal woman in the minds of every pig who slobbers over her. Yet, her new skin only seems to increase her bitterness. What begins as appreciation for the body she once had soon turns into misplaced disgust at the body she has now, and the seeds of self-hatred begin to form alongside an increasing sense of worthlessness... not to mention an increasing dissonance between the two versions of herself. In an appropriately overt way, the ensuing internal battle is rendered physical and, therefore, literal. It's a battle we can all relate to on some level.\n\nWhile the picture clearly provokes some thought on its topic, it doesn't exactly make it a priority to convey any specific message - at least not as unsubtly as you'd expect considering its generally unsubtle nature. It doesn't take a nuanced look at its themes and it doesn't delve into the offshoots said theme naturally produces. Like I said, it's only really about one thing. Its characters are designed specifically to feed into that single aspect, and they therefore aren't particularly complex. However, not every movie needs to make some grand statement about a particular concept or feature intricate characters who capture the contradictions of real people. In fact, most of them don't. To judge this for touching on, but not wholly examining or drawing surprising conclusions from, well-worn yet relevant themes would be somewhat disingenuous. After all, art doesn't have to be poignant or profound to be worth experiencing, and something like this simply needs to put its feet on solid ground so that it can mutate into the primal beast it was always destined to become.\n\nLet me be clear, that stuff is almost universally great. While I don't think the affair is quite as gross as everyone makes it out to be (I was half-expecting a physical reaction based on how some people are talking about it), I also don't want to undersell how grotesque it is. While its heightened reality does somewhat weaken the impact of its more gruesome sequences (it all feels a little unreal, so its more personalised moments of pain don't hit that naturalistic nerve the most unbearable body horror scenes do), it also makes almost every single scene feel vibrant and invigorating. There are some really ambitious, gooey special effects and the body horror goes places I'm not sure I've seen it go before. If I have, it hasn't been often. The flick also makes good use of gross-ups, transforming even 'regular' things into something much more revolting. It makes a point of having Dennis Quaid's character be utterly repulsive every time he (dis)graces the screen with his presence. A scene in which he eats shrimp is one of the picture's most unbearable. Although some of them could have been more painful, the movie's more visceral segments are mostly successful and occasionally even somewhat distressing. Because the film is unafraid of absurdity (as all the best horror is), it's also the sort of thing that you might be tempted to chuckle at. It's easier to laugh than it is to allow yourself to feel fear, and - even though I didn't find any of it particularly funny - there were one or two laughs in the screening I attended. If you allow yourself to think about the implications and consequences of its violence and transformations, though, it can be quite disturbing. There are some unsettling ideas and images to be found here.\n\nDirector Coralie Fargeat is similar to Julia Ducournau in that her second film is bigger and more ambitious - at least formally, structurally, and aesthetically - than her debut, but it's arguably less successful - perhaps because it's less focused. When you have this many plates to spin, it's kind of inevitable some will fall. For example, a lot of the picture is shot like a Pepsi/ Coke commercial with a lot of focus on the female form in an overtly sexualised way. It's very, very male gaze-y despite being directed by a woman. Of course, that's the point. Like she did with 'Revenge (2017)', Fargeat is playing with audience expectation and subverting filmmaking tropes to comment on how celluloid treats gender. It's a type of close-to-the-chest satire that never calls itself out as such. However, I don't think the filmmaker ever quite subverts - or, even, comments on - the idea strongly enough to fully justify the constant hyper-sexualisation of Qualley's character. A lot of it is meant to reflect how the lead feels sexy in her new skin and has a renewed sense of self-worth, but the there's so much leering that the work the picture does to offset it just doesn't seem sufficient. There's an argument to be made that the piece isn't as interested in converting those who don't get it as it is in validating those who do; despite its bluntness, it doesn't feel the need to prove itself. While its final third goes some way in making it clear that it isn't interested in pleasing its male audience, it steps into sticky territory in the process. If this movement is specifically designed to be unsexy - repulsive, even - as a way of punishing, or calling into question, the audience's participation in the prior sexualisation, then it falls into the trap of being unempathetic, of putting you in the shoes of its antagonistic forces, of using a woman's body as a punchline to a cruel joke. It doesn't quite go all the way in that direction, and I still think it's a feminist work overall, but it's worth mentioning.\n\nDespite some notable flaws, though, I love that this was made. There's almost nothing I appreciate more than when a film just does whatever it wants to with no concern for expectation or genre. Foreign-language films tend to be a lot more fluid with genre, so when non-American filmmakers make the move to Hollywood (or pseudo Hollywood), they often bring their refreshingly less-than-mainstream ideas with them. Whether they're allowed to keep them in their movie is another matter, but when they are it's often glorious. In this case, the picture eventually goes in a surprising new direction that almost completely upends the established status quo while somehow feeling like a totally natural extension. I knew the final twenty minutes were meant to be wild. However, I expected them to be wild in the usual sense where the tension breaks and some dudes get their heads caved in or whatever. I didn't for a second expect the last act to go as hard and as fast into total freakshow territory as it does. The feature unashamedly transforms itself into an almost entirely different movie, one that's more brazen and bizarre than you can imagine. Perhaps it doesn't one-hundred percent work, but I totally appreciate the effort. I'm really glad it just goes for it.\n\nAlthough it's arguably a tiny bit too long for its own good, isn't as deep as it could have been, is sometimes too on the nose even considering its maximalism and doesn't quite justify its intense level of hyper-sexualisation, the film feels like a breath of fresh air. It's really good, despite its flaws, and I like it more and more with each word I write. It's wonderfully, wonderfully weird. It's entertaining. It's exhilarating. It's arguably essential. It's exactly what it wants to be. It reminds me of some 80s splatter horror at times, which I didn't expect but really enjoyed. The performances are great, even if I don't quite believe Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley are the same person, and they're unafraid to lay everything bare and put it all on the line bring this thing to life. It's stylish beyond belief. It's goopy and gory and going to be talked about for quite a while. We need more movies like 'The Substance (2024)'."", 'So what happens when you take David Cronenberg, Darren Aronofsky, Stanley Kubrick and you put them all in a blender? You get ""The Substance"".\n\nGreat body horror in the style of the 80s. Great performance by Demi Moore (easily her best role ever), Margaret Qualley and Dennis Quaid. Great direction, editing, sound, cinematography, production and makeup. All the elements are there but the ending is pretty dumb and the script seems to lack... Some substance.\n\nOverall, great original and refreshing movie in the style of 80s Cronenberg.\n\nWriter/director Coralie Fargeat definitely made her mark and I\'ll be looking forward to her next movie.\n\nHighly recommended.', ""Implausibly implausible, it took me until the final scenes to realise what genre I was watching. Up to that point I found myself thinking 'as if' or 'get lost' at some of the plot while being satisfactorily entertained by Margaret Qualley's naked body.\n\nTherein lies the problem - as a 'dark comedy' or comedy horror it doesn't quite make it for me and I can't really explain why. It's got an 8/10 rating on IMDb so I'm beginning to think I am the problem, not the film. I'll try: There isn't enough comedy or wit, although more than adequate boobs, butt and blood for the genre. No more than average acting performances although being a slave to my desires I found Margaret Qualley outstanding simply by losing her clothes or dressing like a fantasy hooker. Maybe I approached the film too seriously but hey, somebody has to give it a low score so it might as well be me."", 'The Substance(2024) is experimental, gross, thought-provocative and shockingly-disgusting.\n\nThe Substance achieves what David Cronenberg wishes to achieve - a body horror film with a cohesive theme. Coralie Fargeat\'s film explores Hollywood\'s most uncomfortable truth - ageism (ironically), and also the industry\'s unrealistic beauty standards which prompt artists\' obsession with plastic surgery. The Substance simply turns this phenomenon into a symbolism with the body\'s metamorphism, adding a bit of hyperbole.\n\nWhat I admire about the screenplay is that though it\'s cliché and predictable, in these predictable moments director Fargeat always offers us something unexpected. That\'s the brilliance of the screenplay. Without spoiling too much, we all can predict things can go very wrong for Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), but you will never expect the ending (my cinema literally roared and grossed out). One of the brilliant settings is that Sue (Margaret Qualley) is technically a separate entity from Elisabeth, they don\'t share the same conscience, but their relationship is parasitic (the situation can only get worse for Elisabeth, umm wait til you see). They both chase the same goal of beauty, but they cannot both have it. Sue was born because Elisabeth was obsessed with beauty, but eventually, Sue became Elisabeth\'s ideal version while Elisabeth descended to something more abominable. Elisabeth achieved her goal but she couldn\'t get what she wanted, her jealousy amplified and that\'s when the screenplay questioned the absurdity of the beauty standards.\n\nFargeat\'s Substance is also influenced by lots of classics, notably Cronenberg\'s The Fly or Carpenter\'s The Thing, but the prosthetics here feel so realistic even on the digitally-washed screen. Wochowski\'s The Matrix influenced some of the terms coined here, and Morpheus\'s red-pill-blue-pill scene is also in the interplay. Kubrick\'s filmography also inspired some of the sequences, such as the colour scheme of the studio\'s long hallway (which recurs a lot, perhaps symbolising Elisabeth\'s long and unending journey) resembles the tone in The Shining or Clockwork Orange; the bloodbath from The Shining in Shelley Duvall\'s perception/imagination, and Also Sprach Zarathustra played near the end like how 2001: A Space Odyssey started.\n\nThe performances are applaudable, yet the horrors of this film shadow them. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley played a perfect pair of opposite parts, their powerhouse performance made the horror much more believable. Dennis Quaid makes you uncomfortable, he is selfish and utilitarian, he exploits the artists and ""eats"" them up like any other shareholders. But overall the film feels like a 2.5-hour-long fitness commercial, and it\'s too modern and stylized, unlike the 80s body horror films. The ending is also quite ridiculous but who cares, body horrors aren\'t real, right?', ""An aging celebrity uses a mysterious black-market a cell-replicating substance that creates a younger, enhanced version of herself with dire consequences.\n\nDirector Coralie Fargeat's socially aware body horror gives David Cronenberg and Brian Yuzna a run for their money. With echoes of Seconds (1966) by John Frankenheimer, the film is audaciously gross, clever, and memorable. Excellent performances, Kubrick-like visuals, and on-location shooting ground the film's brilliant graphic special effects.\n\nBenjamin Kracun's cinematography, paired with Fargeat's stylish production and direction, delivers an intriguing and unforgettable film. Raffertie's pulse-pounding, stirring music amplifies the on screen shenanigans and horror. There's aerobics segments that echo Perfect (1985) Benny Benassi and Eric Prydz music videos in contrast to the chilling scenes.\n\nAlthough the script is thin on dialogue Margaret Qualley is mesmerising as Sue. Demi Moore plays on her own stardom image with a vulnerable, vanity-free performance as Elisabeth Sparkle in a riotous, dreamlike Picture of Dorian Gray-style horror-thriller that builds to a crescendo of blood and gore. There's an array of quirky support ing characters that wouldn't be out of place in a David Lynch offering.\n\nOverall, Fargeat delivers a gross wild ride, it's worth watching for Moore's and Qualley's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde performances alone."", ""A sleek, Neon Demon-style Hollywood parable, Demi Moore puts in a career-high performance as a fading star desperately seeking a high risk cosmetic procedure to regain her appearance and youth. Of course, things don't go according to plan.\n\nBeautifully shot, tightly edited, shiny and hyper-stylised, the film throbs, grinds, and builds its way to utterly insane, Thing-style, stomach-turning, brilliant, and bizarre climax. Aside from its great script (fantastic villain, dash of dark humour throughout to add to its flavour) and directorial vision, another stand-out is the visceral soundtrack and sound design: slimy, gross - perfect.\n\nI cannot recommend this movie enough - if your stomach can take it!"", '""The Substance"" strikes a compelling balance between homage and imitation, weaving in visual and thematic echoes of cult 80s horror films while sparking debates about originality in modern cinema. The glowing yellow substance recalls the reanimation serum from Re-Animator, embodying the same mysterious and transformative allure. The visceral body modifications and surreal scenes call back to Cronenberg\'s aesthetic in Videodrome and eXistenZ, with grotesque beauty and organic-mechanical hybrids pushing boundaries.\n\nThe monstrous transformation of Elizabeth draws parallels to Basket Case, echoing the tragic horror of malformed beings, and the grotesque degeneration in The Toxic Avenger. ElisaSue\'s blue dress even feels like a cheeky nod to Toxie\'s pink dress, symbolizing human identity eroded by monstrous evolution.\n\nWhile the film brims with nostalgic references, it stumbles under their weight, sometimes feeling derivative rather than groundbreaking. As a viewer, I found myself torn between admiration for its technical craft and frustration at its lack of distinctiveness. Can The Substance carve out its place among the classics it reveres? Time will tell.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of these comparisons and more, check out my Instagram post, where I juxtapose key scenes from The Substance with its inspirations.

During my screening 4 people left the cinema, but not because the film is bad, it\'s just because it has certain visual style and extreme intensity, which some viewers might find overwhelming.\n\nPersonally I think Coralie Fargeat is brilliant, just like Gaspar Noé she is a filmmaker, which is not afraid of taking risks, exploring new avenues of artistic expression in medium of cinema.\n\nNarratively the movie has this synopsis:\n\n""A fading celebrity decides to use a black market drug, a cell-replicating substance that temporarily creates a younger, better version of herself""\n\nAt age 61 Demi Moore makes here tremendously successful, brave comeback to the limelight. Not only because she showcases plenty of her nudity, but being able to dig deep in her subconscious, being naked emotionally, as well as being fearless, making herself look absolutely disgusting.\n\nIf this movie wouldn\'t be body horror I would say her performance deserve Oscar Nomination, sadly horror movies are often snubbed in nominations as horror genre lowers vibrational frequency of the body through fear emotion.\n\nMargaret Qualley former ballet dancer delivers star making performance as a younger version of Demi Moore, which with her grace and charm is able to hypnotize the audience in to self worship .\n\nDennis Quaid who replaced late Ray Liota delivers very two faced sleazy performance as TV exacutive which is obsessed with youthfulness and power.\n\nHowever where the movie excels the most is the filmmaking aspect. The camera work is superb and in fact this film needs to be seen by all directors of photography, as it is breaking the canon of how theatrical films are normally shot.\n\nCoralie uses an extreme closeups very frequently to the point that the whole aspect of macro-micro of the world is stating to bland in. Her choice of macro lenses can sometime make the audience feel emotionally drained (this is why some people leave the screening), but as she uses this technique it has narrative purpose more then just being a visual candy. Often framing things in the middle DP uses vanishing point to enhance depth in the frame.\n\nAlso use fisheye lenses in close ups distorts the actors making them less attractive.\n\nThe sound design is superb bringing the aspect of horror to full emotion impact. And again this film should be showcased in film school to teach students how to use sound design for enchantment of what is happening onscreen.\n\nUltimately\'THE SUBSTANCE\' is a journey through surrealism, but kept in commercialized visual coverage, with heavy emphasis on body horror specially in act 3 where things go really extreme.\n\nThink of this film as if surrealism of David Lynch and David Cronenberg body horror, had a monster baby and Gaspar Noä and Brian De Palma (the bloody act 3 heavily influenced by \'Carrie\') were the godparents.\n\nHighly disturbing and yet groundbreaking at the same time \'THE SUBSTANCE\' will have the power to polarize the audiences with some, loving the movie, others will feel sense of disgust. Occasionally deeply comedic, this is a brave, risk-taking cinema, which isn\'t there to be pleasant for the viewer, but instead it is an impactful journey in to exploration of worship of fame and commercialized youth obsessed couture of mainstream entertainment industry. Coralie Fargeat you did so well here, keep being brave in paving new pathways in to cinema language vocabulary.\n\nHighly recommended for viewers with high intellectual and emotional depth!!!', ""Is it horror? Satire? Art House? Perhaps all of the above. But don't step into this film expecting your standard horror fare. Instead, be ready to laugh-because I did, almost from start to finish. This film playfully stretches the boundaries of satire, pushing them straight into absurdism.\n\nThe sound design is impeccable-10/10 for the production team, whose work amplifies the experience. Special effects are solid, and the makeup team excels, but if you're looking for intricate character development or groundbreaking plotlines, this isn't the film for you.\n\nThat said, Demi Moore is a force of nature as Elizabeth Sparkle, commanding the screen in every scene. Her performance alone elevates this film from quirky to unmissable."", ""This mishmash of countless cinematic influences-does a good job most of the time but eventually betrays it's own rules and lacks logic.\n\nHow can the two bodies be one when it's very clear that they're two different personalities? At first you get the impression that you got one mind sharing two different bodies but all of a sudden it changes and they start fighting each other.\n\nAnother thing: Doesn't Demi Moore have any friends, family, or boyfriends? Apart from a couple of male douches there is less social interaction here than in The Omega Man.\n\nThis one ain't as stupid as Titane but there are some serious credibility issues.\n\nThe science that makes this possible does not make much sense in the same way a Cronenberg film does.\n\nBTW, where was it shot? Its supposed to be Hollywood but if it was shot there, the director sure did a bad job. You don't see a single location whatsoever, just the top of some palm trees.\n\nAt least it delivers gore in spades but last scenes are too far fetch. It seems they didn't know where to stop.\n\nThere also seems to be an anti-meat message in there somewhere. Something about anorexia and veganism. The message behind the movie seems to be that if you're not happy with how you look, just take it easy, things could have been worse. Also every male is a douche or a loser. The scene with the piece of paper that lands in the pool of mud wants to show us something about these characters but let's face it, it doesn't seem real when she picks it up. Why didn't the guy write it again on a clean piece of paper?"", ""This movie is absolutely amazing, I have been stunned about the messages that can be digested in a million ways. The movie is so minimal, the message is so straightforward, yet it can be really interpreted in so many ways, depending where you are as a human in your level of evoluation. Exceptionally great and utterly simple. I have to say that this surely took a lot of courage from Demi Moore, she was soo perfect in this. Margaret's play was also pristine perfection. I love every character and the whole plot, it was perfect as it was done, I wouldn't change anything, really. It tied me to the screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it, usually I'm not that captivated by a movie, but this one, oh my God. I don't want to ruin anyone's experience so I won't give any spoilers. This movie is a must watch for everyone. You can read a lot of complaints about the ending, well, I admit, it was really tough but I think that's also in the right place I got shocked and disturbed at the end. This is the perfect movie for self-awarness, I recommend it to everyone. Really, everyone."", ""This film was very unpleasant to watch.\n\nSimultaneously, it was brilliant and hilarious.\n\nI don't particularly like body horror films -- and please be forewarned -- this is very much a body horror film in so many ways. But it's so much more.\n\nAt some deep level, this is a film about aging, decay, and death. Also, regret, and wistfulness for youth. It's brilliantly cast, with Demi Moore as an aging star, and Margaret Qualley as the alternative to an aging star. Both give fantastic performances.\n\nEssentially, it's a story of how a narcissist might seek a return to youth, and how the younger version might not want to return to older age. But this film becomes wonderfully unhinged quite quickly and somehow manages to escalate from there.\n\nI've seen a lot in my life, but literally found myself covering my mouth with my hand. It think this film is magnificent.\n\nVery unpleasant, but magnificent.\n\nWell done to all involved!"", ""Been looking forward to seeing this movie for a while and all I have to say is wow, it sure had me on the edge of my seat. I had my phone next to me and I couldn't pick it up even if I wanted to, it's that type of movie. In all its craziness and body horror, you just can't help but have your eyes glued to the screen. Demi Moore is fantastic in this film, it's definitely one of her best performances. There were parts where I caught myself just watching it with a wowed look on my face and my jaw to the floor, that's what this film will do to you. I would've given this an 8 if it wasn't for the ending that wasn't very good, however, it still deserves a 7 for what it accomplished in the first 2 acts. Personally I think the gore in this film is worse than the Terrifier movies. With those movies I can laugh at it but with this one, it just grossed me out and left me feeling uneasy. So mission accomplished by the Director! I recommend giving this film a watch once, It's a crazy ride that will have you questioning what the heck you just watched. Also, please don't eat anything while you're watching this, haha."", 'Saw this movie yesterday with great anticipation. And for the first maybe 2/3 of the movie my excpectations were fullfilled. But then it turned from a decent story to an incredible splatter festival with absolutely no sense and credibility. I can only tell everyone: don\'t get caught by the positive reviews, save your money and don\'t go to see this junk. The actors are good (maybe a bit too much from Dennis Quaid) and the basic idea of the story is great. Unfortunately the last 1/3 of the movie seemed like some gore-fans sat together and everybody had even better ideas of how to ""shock"" the audience.', 'Whoever\'s disappointed by the ending deluded themselves into thinking they were watching a different movie. It is raw, it is in your face, it is overacted, it is absurd, and it all *works* because it is also exceedingly honest both to itself and the viewer.\n\nThere wasn\'t a single moment throughout where my eyes weren\'t glued to the screen; the visuals and plot beats are gripping, fascinating, edge of your seat. The ending sequence was delightful and made me think ""oh they are *going* there aren\'t they"". Because yes, it could\'ve gone a different, more demure and depressing route, but it also would have been the more predictable ""been there, done that"" route. All in all I think the movie had an amazing idea and perfect execution; what more could you ask for.', ""I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Surprised also by the fact that Demi Moore plays in a horror movie, not really the genre we are used to from her. And even if it's not really a scary story the bloody parts are pretty gore and well shot. I thought the cinematography was excellent, with many various close-up shots of good quality. Margaret Qualley and Demi Moore (even after her horrible body modifications) are eye candy, pleasant to look at. Dennis Quaid only has a minor role in this movie but was certainly convincing in playing his character. All in all The Substance is worth watching, certainly if you like a bit of gore."", ""There have been so many high concept horrors in recent years which don't have the confidence to take their ideas far enough to justify their existence as cinema. Skincare is one recent example, similarly focusing on the trappings of fame/beauty colliding with vulnerability. The Substance, finally, reaches those places I've been craving in cinema - delivering a unique experience which is only possible by confidentially taking ideas to their necessary absurd, indulgent climactic levels.\n\nThe comparisons to Cronenberg are justified, and there are some direct references to The Fly. But also, early Aronofsky or even Jonathan Glazer for his clinical, Kubrickian eye.\n\nI was even reminded in places of Michael Crichton's Looker, which while being forty years old now taps into similar themes.\n\nIt's a shame Ray Liotta died before filming, as I feel his performance would have been better than Quaid's. Quaid was a bit too cartoonish and acty, a different vibe to the rest of the film.\n\nAbsolutely worthy of seeing at the cinema, one of the very few films of recent years which I think demands it."", ""This story reminds me of a really good Black Mirror episode: It is compelling and satirical. The performances are great. The only thing that keeps this movie from being stellar is the lack of editing. The special effects could have been amazing, but the camera lingers on them so long that they become less and less striking. Demi Moore gives a stellar performance, which makes the film worth seeing, but the movie could have been so great if the director and editors had realized that at times maybe less is Moore (sorry, couldn't resist). I realize that today's audiences are used to more visceral shock value than, say, Hitchcock would have delivered. But I am not asking for a Hitchcock level of subtlety. I only wish that please, please, don't bludgeon us over the head with special effects or the effects will not be so special. And that's what happens in The Substance. Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid give everything you could ask for in this movie. Also, the soundtrack is note perfect. There's a lot to like here despite my critique."", 'I had high hopes for this movie after I saw the 15 minute standing ovation at Cannes that the film received as well as the press interviews I\'d seen the cast do. I set my mind to an open state because I knew it was ""different"" based on everything I\'d read and watched about the movie.\n\nThis movie definitely has a very strong message about our obsession with youth and it makes that point on so many levels. It\'s so graphic and so over the top that I can see why reviewers will call this an instant cult classic.\n\nMy suggestions to anyone who hasn\'t seen it yet, to go in with an open mind and don\'t expect a dramatic/psycho/horror type film. This is not that. This is of its own category. It does it\'s job and I left the theater a new fan of Coralie Fargeat. I\'m so interested to see what she does next.\n\nDemi Moore is a class act and does a fantastic job in this film and Margaret Qualley plays the hell out of this role and gives us lots of eye candy.', ""The Substance is an absolute trip. Coralie Fargeat delivers a slick, grotesque commentary on our obsession with youth, turning the vanity of Hollywood into a nightmare you can't look away from-even when you want to.\n\nDemi Moore and Margaret Qualley are perfectly cast, playing off each other as two sides of the same, warped coin. The film's satirical edge and surreal visuals hit hard, even if the final act spirals into chaos. Just when you think the film has hit its peak in squeamishness, an even more depraved visual lurks just around the corner. Love it or hate it, The Substance is an experience you won't forget."", 'A fading celebrity, Elizabeth Sparkle, decides to use a black-market drug, a cell-replicating substance that temporarily creates a younger, better version of herself. ""The Substance"" is a film that talks about aging, body dysmorphia, and the extremely ridiculous amount of body standards that society sets for women in general. As per Rotten Tomatoes, the film\'s synopsis goes like this: ""Have you ever dreamt of a better version of yourself? You are only better in every way. You should try this new product; it\'s called The Substance. IT CHANGED MY LIFE. With The Substance, you can generate another you: younger, more beautiful, more perfect. You just have to share time -- one week for one, one week for the other. A perfect balance of seven days each... Easy right? If you respect the balance... What could possibly go wrong?"" Reading from this synopsis, even without watching the trailer, you\'ll know what the film will be like; from the get-go, you\'ll understand the dilemma, the character\'s motives, and intentions. However, despite being on the nose, the film will surprise you on so many levels.\n\nThe movie\'s most surprising aspect is the sheer number of references that pay homage to classic horror films. It\'s abundantly clear that the director, Coralie Fargeat, holds a deep respect for the genre, as she makes these references unsubtly, adding a layer of entertainment for horror fans. For instance, Elisabeth Sparkle\'s transformation and obsession closely resemble Nina Sayers\' metamorphosis in Darren Aronofsky\'s ""Black Swan."" The vibrant corridor scenes are heavily inspired by Stanley Kubrick\'s ""The Shining."" Moreover, the closeup shots serve as a nod to David Cronenberg\'s classics, ""Videodrome"" and ""The Fly."" Even the revelation of the ""monster"" at the film\'s climax shares a notable similarity to the unveiling in David Lynch\'s ""The Elephant Man."" In an interview, Coralie Fargeat mentioned that David Lynch is one of her inspirations for the film, further cementing these connections. Furthermore, the bloodbath scene in the final 15 minutes of the movie bears a strong resemblance to the classic feminist horror film ""Carrie,"" both depicting female rage driven by societal oppression. These intentional, well-crafted references make the film a gratifying experience for horror cinema fans.\n\nDemi Moore\'s performance as Elisabeth Sparkle is career-defining-definitely her best performance throughout her career. Her bold and audacious performance allowed the audience to fully submerge into her character, showcasing her raw and authentic emotion to Elisabeth\'s inner turmoil. One notable scene in the film that showcased Moore\'s range was the mirror scene, from subtle envy and insecurities to extreme rage and anger to hatred. Moore has never had any chance to commit to a role like this in her previous films; she has allowed herself to be seen by the audience in a different light.\n\nOn the other hand, Margaret Qualley\'s performance is a revelation and a testament to her exceptional talent. She has proven herself to be one of the best actresses of this generation. Throughout the year, Margaret has been one of the young actresses who were constantly in a good film but were overlooked due to her characters\' limited resources or being overshadowed by her co-actors. In this film, she was able to, not outperform Demi Moore, but gave a bold and horrific performance as ""Sue,"" or the better version of Demi Moore\'s character. Both actresses were able to play their characters differently, but at the same time, you know that they are one. Their inner turmoil for success, validation, and societal pressure is evident in the characters they play.\n\nI mean, it\'s definitely an Oscar-worthy performance. Still, due to the Academy\'s bias and hatred towards the horror genre, it\'s almost impossible for them to get a nomination in the acting category for a body-horror film (we still can\'t get over the fact that they robbed Toni Collette of that Oscar statue, heck, even a nomination).\n\n""The Substance"" is likely the best body-horror film I\'ve seen in recent years. While everything is quite direct, the film also possesses deep layers. The opening scene alone sets the stage for how grotesque and disturbing the film will become, and it doesn\'t disappoint in its bold approach to body horror. The direction is straightforward and precise, allowing the audience to immerse themselves fully in the experience. Certain aspects of the direction are particularly clever and brilliant, especially when we see things from Elisabeth and Sue\'s perspectives. This approach smartly and effectively allows the audience to embody the characters and experience their agony fully. Although the movie could have benefited from a more polished and well-executed finale, it maximizes the body-horror experience, which sometimes becomes almost comical, especially in the last 15 minutes. Nevertheless, the film successfully delivers its purpose through a very on-the-nose and humorous direction.\n\nIt\'s the kind of film that will linger in your mind, or even haunt you, long after the credits roll. Experiencing the last 30 minutes in a packed theater is incredibly satisfying; the collective gasps, some people throwing up, and the unified shouting create a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. This is just a pure cinematic experience we\'ve been missing in recent years, and as a horror fan, I\'m thrilled to experience it again. Cinema is back!\n\nOne piece of advice: do not watch this film while eating or drinking. Trust me, I don\'t have many regrets in life, but doing so during ""The Substance"" is definitely one of them. It\'s a film so nasty and disturbing that you might find yourself needing to cleanse your palate with something light-hearted, like a Disney-Pixar film, to recover. In summary, ""The Substance"" stands out in the body-horror genre, offering a raw, visceral experience that will leave a lasting impression. With phenomenal performances from Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley and a bold and innovative direction, this film is a must-watch for horror enthusiasts. Just be prepared for a ride that will test the limits of your stomach and your psyche.', ""Well, that was a ride. Tremendous performance by Moore and a great commentary on how society in this day and age puts pressure on people to be their perfect selves at all times. It gets more bizarre by the minute but when you accept it's not supposed to reflect reality you can just sit back and enjoy the ultimately horrific ride it becomes. Perhaps a little long but definitely worth the watch. What I found distracting - and hysterical - is that new found MAGA nut and Trump supporter Dennis Quaid is pretty much playing Donald Trump in this movie. The irony is that Quaid obviously doesn't realise it..."", ""Besides being among the most thrilling and batshit crazy movie theatre experiences you could possibly imagine, 'The Substance' represents high art cinema at its finest, at least for me. It's rare to see a film so full of grotesque imagery also feels so... intentional. The body horror here isn't just shock for shock's sake-it's the kind of grotesque that's earned. Every frame feels meticulously crafted to serve a point, reflecting our society's fetishization of youth and the disturbing lengths people go to reclaim it. It's unsettling but never gratuitous, which is a line most films in this space tend to trip over.\n\nThis is a savage takedown of beauty standards and ageism, wrapped in a stylish, nightmarish package. It challenges you to look beyond the visceral horror and really think about what it's saying about the world we live in. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley's fearless performances (Demi in particular, give that woman the damn oscar) take this film to another level in their ability to fearlessly dive into the raw, ugly truth of their characters. They embody this world with razor sharp precision. The academy better not mess this one up..."", 'Cronenberg style love it, if you are a fan of b horror movies you have seen this many times before.\n\nBack in the eighties there were a few horror movies pretty much like this one, an aging actress paying a lot of money to a scientist to reverse her age and regain popularity in her career, but yet when she took the serum each time she turned into a monster and got older.\n\nThis movie as a lot more finesse to it, and is way more in the veins of a David Cronenberg movie dark, and it will play with your mind and brain.\n\nIts been a long time since we saw Demi Moore in such a great role, Margaret Qualley had no clue who she was but turned out to be one great actress too.\n\nThis movie is a great addition to dark horror. Very good rating for an horror movie too.', ""This is without doubt one of the worst movies i have ever sat through. The performances by all concerned are fine but the whole concept is so dumb it beggars belief.\n\nI can't see why it is getting any praise at all. The make-up effects are good, but not great, in fact the standard drops as the film progresses, the last twenty minutes or so being downright awful.\n\nWhere are the great visuals and editing mentioned by so many? Where is the strong feminine message? How on earth can you possibly compare this badly paced, ill conceived fiasco with the works of Cronenberg or Kubrick?\n\nIf this is genuinely being considered one of the best films of the year then modern cinema is in a truly terrible state.\n\nAvoid."", 'Fountain of Youth tales go back centuries, as do stories of Hollywood valuing physical attractiveness and vigor. French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat goes at those themes with a vengeance in THE SUBSTANCE (which she also wrote).\n\nElizabeth Sparkle is an Oscar winning actress who\'s had a second career as an Exercise and Fitness guru on a long-running TV show (shades of Jane Fonda). When she hits the big 5-0, her piggish Producer (Dennis Quaid) named Harvey (wink, wink) decides it\'s time to put her out to pasture. After a medical procedure, a handsome Nurse (Robin Greer) slips her a note with a phone number about a mysterious potion that will change her life - The Substance. Desperate, Elizabeth contacts the clandestine outfit and goes through the process. Shazam! Elizabeth spawns a gorgeous doppelganger dubbed Sue (Margaret Qualley). The catch is that the two halves can\'t co-exist: Elizabeth must be dormant while Sue is dominant, and vice-versa. They are self-vampires.\n\nFargeat and her team have made a sharp looking picture. Stanislas Reydellet\'s production design emphasizes the isolation of the Elizabeth/Sue hybrid. It\'s all long corridors and large, mostly empty, stark spaces. A huge Picture of Dorian Grey-like portrait of a youthful Elizabeth looms over the main living area. Benjamin\'s Kracun\'s cinematography is appropriately cold and sleek, while Raffertie\'s music booms and bounces (quoting Bernard Herrmann\'s VERTIGO and Strauss\' ""Thus Spake Zarathustra""- is not entirely successful). The book-ended prologue and epilogue are spot on.\n\nFargeat\'s screenplay has a number of darkly witty moments and certainly hits its satirical targets concerning beauty, fame and vanity. It\'s a stroke of genius to cast Moore as the lead here as she has certainly been the object of much discussion about aging in Tinseltown, wearing her own plastic surgery as visible reminders of the pressures of maintaining those impossible standards. She\'s excellent, but it would be remiss to not mention that Qualley more than holds her own. Unfortunately, the movie mostly runs out of steam halfway through. It\'s few observations aren\'t so much expanded upon as repeated over and over.\n\nPart of the issue here is the symbiotic Jekyll and Hyde nature is split into two distinct bodies. The mechanics of The Substance inherently work against the psychological possibilities here. The covert entity behind the product keeps insisting that Elizabeth and Sue ""are one"", but they rarely share the screen, instead opting for the pair to mutter under their breath about how the other is ruining their individual life. Further, Fargeat further isolates the pair by having so few supporting characters. Neither Elizabeth nor Sue seem to have any friends, relatives or work confidantes. They literally have ""no life"" (clearly part of the script\'s plan, but not very edifying nor dramatic). Harvey is a garish cartoon figure as are the other all male authority figures - they make the Mattel execs in BARBIE seem like well rounded gentlemen by comparison. Having even one female person in charge (or as an enabler) would have added some much needed layering to the satire. Fargeat instead opts for base parody.\n\nBy the time Fargeat tries to top Norma Desmond\'s fall from sanity, the movie has exhausted itself - and, yet lingers on for another 20 minutes or so. The makeup effects (by Olivier Afonso and team) are very well done and there\'s nothing inherently wrong with extreme body horror but it all overstays its welcome. David Cronenberg has long been looked upon as the master of this sub-genre and for good reason - he understands that pulp should be swift and to the point (there are several specific allusions to his version of THE FLY here). A more recent example is the Cannes Award winning TITANE by Julia Ducourneau. THE SUBSTANCE is a fascinating and entertaining film. It\'s also hard to dislike a movie too much that depicts snow in Los Angeles!', ""The Substance takes you on a wild ride, exploring themes of beauty, identity, and self-destruction. It follows a fading celebrity who turns to a black-market drug, a cell-replicating substance, to create a younger, more flawless version of herself. This movie will leave you talking. How far would you go to meet society's beauty standards? Would you follow the rules, or would you do anything, no matter the cost?\n\nVisually, The Substance is bold and stunning. From the tight close-ups to the long shots, every frame tells its own story. The cinematography alone is worth talking about.\n\nIf you're a fan of body horror, you're in for a treat. The gore in this movie is on a whole other level. Its gruesome, shocking, and jaw-dropping. But it's not just there for shock value, every gross moment serves a purpose. This level of body horror is something i haven't seen in a long time, and it'll definitely leave an impression.\n\nThe blend of practical effects and CGI is perfect, creating some of the best body horror visuals I've ever seen. It's a horror fan's dream come true. They truly nailed it, and it's hard to put into words just how perfect everything comes together.\n\nAs for the ending? I loved it. I promise, You will never predict how it's going to finish.\n\nDemi Moore gives it her all, I wish she had more screen time, She brings so much to the role.\n\nMargaret Qualley is also fantastic, giving us a strong performance.\n\nThe only downside to the film is its runtime. Some repetitive scenes could have been trimmed down or cut. But that's a minor flaw.\n\nAs for rewatchability, it's there, though it might not be as frequent as other horror films. But it's one you won't forget anytime soon."", ""Yeah, I've read all the other reviews. It is Cronenbergesque, definitely some Kubrick, and a ton of references to Requiem for a Dream. My wife walked out after the first hour and I saw a couple other wives or girlfriends walk out to talk in the lobby. The director and writer of this film is a woman. I really can't figure out why some viewers at my theater thought this was an offensive film. It was definitely pro-female aka a feminist film. My mind is blown by the bizarre interpretations I've heard tonight. Demi Moore deserves the awards she will get. You all know the plot. It's pitch-black comedy and body horror. The last 45 minutes were one of the greatest cinema experiences of my life, listening to a group of humans howl with laughter and scream and cover their eyes and ears in equal measure. It's a metaphorical movie. Most of us got it. Some did not. What are you gonna do? It just is what it is."", ""Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore) is a fading movie star. She may have a Hollywood star but she is turning fifty. She only has her long running TV exercise program and producer Harvey (Dennis Quaid) is looking to replace her with someone younger.

The serum program splits Sparkle into her older shell and a younger body in Sue (Margaret Qualley).\n\nI've only seen one other film from Coralie Fargeat. The lady certainly tries hard cinematically. She is putting a lot into this Hollyweird satire. It digs hard especially casting former Hollywood A-lister Demi Moore. This is the perfect role for her and probably for Margaret Qualley as well. Qualley is travelling a similar trajectory as Demi although maybe not as tabloid worthy. This film allows Demi to exorcise some real world demons. I do have a problem with the length of the movie. The middle part feels slower by comparison. She could have faced more challenges in that section. Her packages could be stolen or a serum could break. It needs something external. In the end, it is self-sabotage and that's not as exciting. It is rather poignant, but Sue is also rather dumb. I guess it's like an addiction. All in all, this is very good and deserves most of the praises."", '""The Substance"" is a horror film that dares to take a satirical bite out of Hollywood, delivering a biting commentary on the industry\'s obsession with youth and beauty. This body horror flick is a grotesque and unsettling exploration of the lengths people will go to maintain their appearance, even if it means sacrificing their humanity.\n\nThe film follows Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), a once-beloved aerobics instructor whose world crumbles when she is abruptly fired. Desperate to reclaim her lost glory, she accepts a mysterious offer that promises to transform her into a more ""enhanced"" and younger version of herself, Sue (Margaret Qualley). The one excpetion is that they essentially have to swap bodies every 7 days in order to maintain balance in order for the treatment to remain effective.\n\nDemi Moore delivers a tour-de-force performance as Elisabeth, a woman desperate to cling to her relevance in a youth-obsessed industry. Her transformation is both shocking and unsettling, a physical manifestation of the lengths to which people will go to maintain their appearance. Margaret Qualley is equally impressive as a sinister younger body double who becomes obsessed with her quest to the primary host in the world. The two actresses share a palpable chemistry that elevates the film\'s tension and suspense.\n\nCoralie Fargeat\'s direction is bold and uncompromising, delivering a visual feast of grotesque imagery and disturbing body horror as she makes a statement that she has arrived in the horror genre.\n\nThe practical effects are truly horrifying, capturing the film\'s themes of decay and transformation with visceral power. The film\'s pacing is relentless, keeping the audience on edge from the opening scene to the shocking finale.\n\nAll in all, this film feels like a spiritual sequel to the movie ""X"" crossed with David Cronenberg\'s ""The Fly"". If you are a fan of body horror, then this is one for you....however remember that this satirical film, otherwise the third act will lose you.', ""I was really excited to see this. The topic was of great interest and I was glad to see Demi Moore in a lead. The movie started out in a somewhat realistic manner, seemed almost plausible. Then as it got going it became less so. Particularly in the third act, the movie fell apart for me. It gave Carrie on steroids vibe.\n\nOne part of the movie I found that did not make any sense was when she returned to the New Year's party taping event with a mask on her face and no one seemed to notice anything amiss. This was really jarring given that the mask she wore was of a person who was vwery much not wanted yet everyone welcomed her with open arms.\n\nIf one is squeamish, probably this would be a good one to miss. Even with my medical background, I found myself looking away a lot.\n\nDemi Moore is perfect. I hope Hollywood can find more good roles for her."", ""The Substance pushes things so far I started wondering if it was satirical satire. A whole new level of pushing boundaries that are already being pushed. It deals with important things but drives those things home in such a brutally in-your-face ways that you almost want to roll your eyes. But you can't roll your eyes, because they're pointed away from the screen, because The Substance is disgusting (in intentional ways, of course).\n\nIt feels like many familiar horror movie conventions rolled into something thrillingly original. It's psychological horror at the same time as being body horror, and it deals with living a double life and having a doppelgänger in a very interesting way. Every element has been seen elsewhere in some capacity, but never remixed in quite the same way as is shown here.\n\nFor that, The Substance is mostly brilliant. The best thing I can say about it is that it was 140 minutes and felt more like 100. The effects used throughout are awesome; it's either all practical, or it's fantastic cgi that looks convincingly practical. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley are both excellent. And Coralie Fargeat is now two for two, because both Revenge and The Substance were pretty great.""]",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/a-substancia/7fcc65d8-a3d2-447c-8d04-144600a488fc.webp
