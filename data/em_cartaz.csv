0,Ainda Estou Aqui,Ainda Estou Aqui,2024,136,['Walter Salles'],"['Murilo Hauser', 'Heitor Lorega', 'Marcelo Rubens Paiva']","['Fernanda Torres', 'Fernanda Montenegro', 'Selton Mello']",8.9,10000.0,Uma mulher casada com um ex-político durante a ditadura militar no Brasil é obrigada a se reinventar e a traçar um novo destino para si e os filhos depois que a vida de sua família é impactada por um ato violento e arbitrário.,"['Biografia', 'Drama', 'História']",8000000,11328683,"['""I\'m Still Here"" is a powerful portrayal of a moment in Brazilian history that traumatized many people. In a well-constructed atmosphere, the viewer enters the past of a country, a past that is disowned and ignored by the country itself, and this makes the experience of watching ""I\'m Still Here"" in a movie theater in Brazil even more powerful. Of all the Brazilian filmmakers, Walter Salles stands out with his talented direction and interesting photography, and the production is truly impressive. The actors are talented and I want to highlight the younger actors, who certainly give the film a touch of depth and beauty necessary for us to feel the ""magic of cinema"". Regarding the kind human side present in ""I\'m Still Here"", it is wonderful to see a film by a filmmaker who truly understands cinema, who does not present alienated ideas but rather pure and genuine human expression. As a Brazilian, of course, I will be rooting for Walter Salles\' work to be nominated for an Oscar, but I think the goal of making national cinema talked about again has already been achieved. Beautiful film, beautiful message and beautiful performances.', 'Adapted from the novel by Marcelo Rubens Paiva, ""I\'m Still Here"" actually improves on the book by focusing on the Paiva family and how every member was startled and heartbroken by the disappearance of their father (played with deep affection by Selton Mello). Anchored by a powerhouse performance by Fernanda Torres as the matriarch Eunice, the film narrates the horrors of the Brazilian dictatorship without ever being preachy or heavy-handed. By focusing on the human aspects and the sense of loss of those people who never got and answer about their loved one\'s disappearance, the script gets more powerful as it goes along. All the performances from the young actors are top-notch - a rare feat in Brazilian cinema - but it is Fernanda Torres incredibly restrained performance that really stays with you. She\'s persuasive and moving without ever being melodramatic, in a masterful work. This is the best Brazilian film in years, a gift from director Walter Salles (""Central Station""). Pay attention to the brief but powerful cameo by Fernanda Montenegro (an Oscar nominee for ""Central Station"") at the very end. ""I\'m Still Here"" is a movie to cherish and to hold.', ""Brazilian film with the greatest international repercussion in recent years, winner of the best screenplay award at the Venice Film Festival and nominated for an Oscar, I'm Still Here dramatizes the trajectory of the Paiva family between the arrest of Rubens Paiva, the father, and Eunice's struggle after her husband's disappearance. Walter Salles immerses the viewer in the intimacy of this family and makes them an accomplice, making them care about the fate of each one, creating three-dimensional, real, believable characters. Fernanda Torres plays the role of her life, almost a Greek heroine marked by tragedy, with subtlety, without ever falling into excess or caricature. Detailed scenography, lean script, natural interpretations, hand-picked soundtrack, precise editing, everything contributes to the director being able to convey exactly what he set out to do. As I knew the story, I had read the book on which the film is based, in addition to reports about it, my attention focused on the cinematographic solutions used by the director. He manages to turn this particular story into something universal, capable of communicating with audiences anywhere in the world."", 'Living in.brazil, but only came to Brazil much later, the film gives a unique insight as to how it was to live during the dictatorship in 70s Brazil. Besides a window into how Rio looked In the 70s, lifestyle etc.\n\nI would love that people who voted in favour of extreme right would see how the dictatorship worked, feel how it impacted people, that were minimally politically involved and persecuted.\n\nThe film is expertly showing that with subtlety like many small papercuts into the soul how easy it was for someone to dissappear, how basic rights were violated.\n\nIt is a highly topical film and very important, highlighting a wound in Brazilian society that has never really healed. And yet, some people wish for these painful times to return. I hope you watch this masterpiece and start reflecting.', 'The greatest strength of Ainda Estou Aqui lies in its use of memory not as a passive recollection of the past but as an act of resistance to preserve the dignity and identity of those who were brutally silenced. Walter Salles, by revealing the faces, names, and humanity of those whose lives were interrupted by the dictatorship, transforms memory into a manifesto for justice.\n\nEarly on, we see Selton Mello in a sensitive and powerful performance, almost like a breath of tenderness before the storm. He brings to life a loving father, a man who soon becomes the epicenter of a pain that seeps into every corner of the house. What was once a bright home, filled with laughter and ordinary days, is now shrouded by drawn curtains, with the constant presence of strangers and the vigilant eyes of military officers. Walter Salles turns the absence of Rubens Paiva into an invisible character, while the family begins to live a routine suffocated by external fear.\n\nAnd it is Fernanda Torres who gives body and soul to this story; she embodies living resistance, something the dictatorship could never take away: the fierce drive of a woman to rebuild what was destroyed, to keep alive the flame of a story that belongs to her. Eunice Paiva, facing the loss of her husband, the invisible violence of silence, the systematic erasure of a life, finds strength in the ruins. Fernanda portrays her as a woman who, in her quiet struggle, refuses to let horror prevail over memory, to let emptiness triumph over love. Eunice Paiva is a character who, at once, moves and unsettles, because as spectators, we remain alert, expecting dramatic outbursts, unrestrained crying, grand gestures that melodrama has accustomed us to seeing - but Eunice\'s pain does not manifest like that. It is there, deeply buried, engraved in her soul, sustained by a quiet strength that will not let it overflow, for the love of her children. It is a pain that exists without fanfare, that corrodes without screaming, and this restraint makes it all the more devastating. The scene in which Fernanda eats ice cream with her daughters, trying to project a happiness that no longer exists, is magnificent.\n\nBy the end of the film, when I was already shattered, the epilogue delivers Fernanda Montenegro. Just the first movement of her eyes, and I was undone. What Montenegro conveys in that moment, without a word, is masterful. She brings to the screen the strength of a woman who refuses to let the past dissipate, who keeps photos, clippings, dates, and notes not just for herself, but to ensure that memory survives any attempt at erasure - even the erosion of her own Alzheimer\'s.\n\nNothing in Ainda Estou Aqui is incidental or superfluous. The 35mm cinematography is delicately ""Walterian,"" poetic yet raw, managing to be aesthetic without stealing the scene. The absence of a dramatic score is a bold and effective choice, trusting the drama already present, which pulses in the pauses, the gazes, and the breaths. The sound design is punctuated by airplanes, gunfire, and the distant rumble of military vehicles, hinting at the constant horror and invisible control imposed by the dictatorship. The editing is precise, respecting the rhythm of grief without rushing, and the screenplay - sensitive and powerful - allows the actors to shine, letting pain and love resonate through dialogues of precise intensity. The production design, meticulous in its detail, splendidly recreates an era without drawing attention to itself.\n\nThere is something in Walter Salles\' cinema that is a rare delicacy in Brazilian filmmaking: the ability to translate emotion and aesthetics into a language that touches us without being obvious or pedantic. Walter finds beauty in the subtleties, in the shadows, and in what is left unsaid. For him, emotion resides in the details, in the silence, in the frames that vibrate without needing words. This is the work of a mature director who knows exactly when to step in and when to let the story speak for itself.\n\nIt is a remarkable film that makes me even prouder of our national cinema. Ainda Estou Aqui is, without a doubt, already a classic of contemporary cinema.', ""Review of I'm Still Here\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say this is the best movie I've ever seen. I'm Still Here is a 10/10 masterpiece that captures the harrowing reality of Brazil's military dictatorship in the 1970s with a depth and sensitivity that is nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nThere's not a single thing they could've done better. From the soundtrack to the storytelling, I'm Still Here transcends being just a movie-it's a poignant tribute to resilience, family, and the fight for justice. It's a must-watch that will stay with you long after the credits roll.\n\nIt literally took me 10 minutes to get up and leave the movie theater."", '""I\'m Still Here"" goes beyond being just another film about the military dictatorship, offering a human, intense, and brutally intimate portrait of a family unraveling under overwhelming, uncontrollable forces. Walter Salles, with his raw style and unmatched sensitivity, returns to the theme of a country immersed in repression, but rather than focusing on big political events, he zeroes in on their consequences within homes and personal lives. By centering the story on family drama, Salles subverts the expectation of a traditional historical film, avoiding documentary tones or a broad, structural focus. Here, 1970s Brazil is felt through the struggles of the Paiva family, and in the painful details of their shared wounds, Salles portrays the scars left by a dictatorship that, while distorted in collective memory, remains alive in the lives it shattered.\n\nChoosing to center the narrative through Eunice\'s perspective-played by the iconic Fernanda Torres and Fernanda Montenegro-lends the film an undeniable authenticity. While dealing with the loss of her husband, Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), a public figure and defender of the people\'s rights, Eunice has to keep the family together and maintain her children\'s emotional stability. Eunice is the pure embodiment of resilience and motherly love, and her daily routine, her rituals with her children, and moments shared as a family are slices of a once-ordinary life, now wrecked by an abrupt absence. Family dinners and memories of beach outings become painful when revisited after Rubens\' disappearance, as they reveal the empty space left by systemic violence. Salles skillfully uses this family intimacy to show how dictatorship destroys emotional bonds and disrupts each home\'s peace, prompting audiences to reflect on how history is also shaped by losses and silent moments in everyday life.\n\nFernanda Torres\' performance is intensely deserving of praise. She embodies a woman who refuses to let grief immobilize her, balancing the protection of her children with the relentless search for answers about her husband\'s whereabouts. This balance between strength and vulnerability gives Eunice a striking and essential presence in the film. In a moving and remarkably mature performance, Montenegro, as the older Eunice, intensifies the impact of Rubens\' absence, bringing a heavy, almost physical silence that resonates in those who never got the chance to say goodbye. The real-life relationship between Montenegro and Torres as mother and daughter adds authenticity to the transitions across time, making Eunice\'s portrayal even more heartfelt and believable. This genuine continuity allows Salles\' film to transcend mere fiction and reach a depth that only a personal story can achieve.\n\nTechnically, the film is a visual achievement that captures this family\'s intimate pain through meticulously crafted cinematography. The use of confined spaces and close-up shots reveals the characters\' physical and psychological confinement, mirroring the oppression that hangs over their lives. The soundtrack follows the most emotional scenes with an almost mystical quality, blending with the characters\' feelings like a whisper that holds the pains of the past. Salles\' use of music is interesting, not just to intensify the drama but to evoke an almost tangible nostalgia in the air, an echo of absences that can never be overcome. This balance between aesthetics and emotion transforms the film into both a tribute to interrupted lives and a celebration of the struggle for justice and memory.\n\nThe narrative avoids an easy or simplistic conclusion, choosing instead a more contemplative view on the lasting impact of loss. The film moves forward in time, showing us the future of each family member without offering conclusive or comforting answers. What remains is the pain, an indignation turned into strength, and a refusal to let difficult moments fade into oblivion. Rubens\' absence and the commitment of Eunice and her children to preserving his memory result in a catharsis for the audience, as it\'s both inspiring and deeply moving to see how they, even amid so much pain, resist the urge to let Rubens\' legacy be erased-and the film\'s goal to evoke tears was masterfully achieved, at least for me.\n\nOverall, ""I\'m Still Here"" is one of those rare historical films that, instead of adopting a documentary or openly critical stance, takes a humanistic approach that resonates with our deepest emotions and values. Salles proves his mastery as a filmmaker by crafting a story that is, at once, infuriating and inspiring-a work that reminds us of the importance of keeping the memories and voices of the wronged alive. Through a captivating narrative and an extraordinary cast, he turns the story of a Brazilian family into a universal reminder of human dignity and the importance of memory as a form of resistance.', ""I'm Still Here is a very special film. It has a story that makes the viewer very interested in seeing how it unfolds. However, what this film has the best quality for is the Fernanda Torres' performance is moving, captivating, one of the best performances I've ever seen. It's truly surreal how talented she is, just like her mother. Furthermore, the film is directed by Walter Salles who had already worked on the excellent film Central Station, with Fernanda Montenegro, in this film he shows himself to be very competent. He is a very talented guy in what he does. Overall, I'm Still Here is the best foreign film of the year, a beautiful movie."", '""I\'m Still Here"" is a movie about a time in which fear, censorship and torture prevailed in Brazil\'s history, a time that must never come back. However, director Walter Salles develops the theme in a delicate way, presenting us to an united and loving family which longs the return of a missing father and husband. It\'s possible to relate to Eunice\'s pain in so many moments and also imagine how cruel the military dictatorship must have been.\n\nThe movie has bittersweet moments and it builds a place where you feel close to that family, a place full of affection and tenderness. Fernanda Torres performance is amazing, she really deserves all the nominations she\'s going to get in the award season. Selton Mello also develops an outstanding performance as Rubens Paiva. The whole cast is superb and we also have the sublime Fernanda Montenegro as an older Eunice Paiva. The movie is technically beautiful, with a stunning representation of Rio de Janeiro in the 70\'s. I think i speak for a lot of brazilians when i say that it would be so much meaningful if Brazil gets nominated to the Oscars with this one, but despite that, it\'s definitely a must see, a recent masterpiece in brazilian cinema that raises awareness, delights and also might bring you to tears.', 'The most spectacular movie that Brazil has ever produced. Fernanda Torres impeccable.\n\nThe Oscar rarely goes to a country like Brazil, but it is undeniable how deep the film goes. The times of Brazilian dictatorship left deep marks that only a masterpiece like this film can highlight. Its necessary to be alert and strong. Watch it in the cinema and try to hold back your tears! Walter Salles: you are a genius!!!!! If necessary, reading about the real history of the characters in the plot can guide your understanding of the film. Knowing that it is something real makes everything even more impactful. Oscar!!!', 'I mean no disrespect to the real people, their history, to all families that went through something like that. However, I think the movie did not depict the facts as deeper as I expected. Maybe I has better expectations when I saw the ratings here, the reviews...I think they have been biased and missed the basic point in a movie: ""to tell a story that convinces the audience"". It is touching, by one-sided, and missed details - if it was by chance or on purpose, I am not sure. It is like a good ""composition"" but someone missed the pace. It is important to a movie like that to go a little deeper. To ensure all t\'s are crossed and all i\'s are dotted. I didn\'t see that on this movie. The story is too linear, too by the book. It is OK, as I mentioned on my review, but it could be so much better. I think it could have expanded to other similar stories but I understand it was based on a book written by the protagonist\'s son, so it has ties and that\'s totally fair, fine but on a movie...it lacks the right vibe and power we expect given the ""story behind the story"". The actors did it but I totally missed the thrill of it.', ""Well, it's definitely not a movie for everyone. By the great hype the movie's been getting, I expected it to be way better.\n\nFor the big crowd It might be boring. For critics, it may be an interesting movie.\n\nLet me start by saying I understood its purpose. Historically, it's really important, but in terms of entertainment, it lacks tons of stuff, and the mean one is development and a good climax.\n\nThe movie could've explored more of the Brazilian dark times of dictadure, showing the great horror that the media hides up to these days. Therefore, it could've gotten deeper into the family's feelings. I think overall it was superficial and lacked emotion and interest.\n\nCentral Station, by the same director, is an exemple of excellence in Brazilian cinema. I went to the movies expecting something as big as his first hype.\n\nFernanda's acting, though, is out of discussion, and I think that's the only thing the movie's worthy of watching.\n\nAll the time I was like, Well, something great is going to happen, but the movie ended and that moment didn't come."", 'It is rare for a film to move me to the point of feeling deep melancholy and sadness.\n\n""I\'m Still Here"" is one of the best films I\'ve ever had the pleasure of watching. What stands out the most is that it is Brazilian, from my homeland, made from the history of my country, from one of the darkest chapters of our past... And all of this is told through the story of a simple family, living simple, happy days, until a tragedy overwhelmed everything and took away that simple happiness.\n\nThe film does have its flaws, many of which are subjective to my perspective-things I would have done differently during the editing process. That\'s all. Overall, the film is exceptionally well-shot, with a beautiful soundtrack that makes great use of our Brazilian music. The performances are flawless in every sense. The comedic moments bring a light and laid-back tone, while the more intense scenes make it clear that the film aims to convey a heavy, realistic message, depicting events that marked our people.\n\nI am pleased to see that not only the world but also the Brazilian people are valuing this work.\n\nI truly hope that, at long last, the Oscars will recognize this achievement and honor our beloved Fernanda Torres-an actress who emerged from one of the greatest actresses in the world, Fernanda Montenegro, who remains unjustly overlooked by the Academy.', ""Masterpiece.\n\nDelicate, sensitive, and yet so incredibly strong and sad.\n\nEveryone should watch this.\n\nFernanda Torres as Eunice Paiva is one of the most beautifully played carachaters I have ever seen.\n\nI'm Still Here displays the cruelty, sadness and unbelievable days Brazil went through during the dictatorship. Walter Salles' loving touch is there on every scene and makes the movie one very emotional piece that will make you wonder how is it possible to show such a horrible moment with so much kindness, subtilty, and sensitivity. Absolutely genius! A must watch. Definitely Foreign Language Movie favorite on the award season."", ""One of the best films of all time. I dont have to many words, it means more than just Brazil history, it recreates the reality of dictatures all around the world. Salles bring us one touch of reality beyond frontiers, i NEED to watch it again, so many pieces left behind around the 1970's south america crisis, Montenegro steals the show in my opinion with the best expression of pain im front of pur eyes, while the director creates a new point of view around the terrorism of the military forces. HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME, SALLES?\n\nIn other words, just give the oscar to montenegro and salles (and maybe screenplay as well)."", 'The outstanding acting! I remember learning about the fact of the Brazilian dictatorship pretty young. We learn about it at school. I was probably around 11 the first time I heard about it, and as kids, as we grow, we keep learning more about it throughout time, but, you know, it\'s History... A boring subject from school for which we barely memorize the dates and headlines of the historical events in order to have good grades at the end of the semester. I heard about it my whole life, my grandparents lived it as adults, even so, the memories got carried away. ""The Brazilian military dictatorship"" becomes simply a brunch of meaningless words. The scars are all that\'s left. Having said that, this makes the moment of watching this movie the moment I felt the weight of our History on my shoulders and my heart for the first time. Fernanda Torres\' acting took me to the edge where her character finds herself after her world crumbles down. I had to remember to breath a few times. Agony, anxiety, empathy. I could feel her pain, her strength, and yet, she does it in a way that made me cry from watching her holding her tears. It moved me. And that\'s what art is for. That\'s what this movie is. It\'s art, it\'s a memory, it\'s resistance.', ""I'M STILL HERE is a poignant and heart-wrenching film that sheds light on Brazil's military dictatorship, focusing on the tragic story of Eunice Paiva and her fight for justice after the disappearance of her husband, Rubens Paiva. Fernanda Torres delivers an extraordinary performance as Eunice, capturing the emotional complexity of a woman torn between hope and despair. Her portrayal is so compelling that she could very well be a contender for an Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nThe film's direction is both sensitive and impactful, showcasing the harsh realities of a dark period in Brazil's history. The cinematography complements the narrative, highlighting the tension, fear, and the quest for truth in a politically turbulent environment.\n\nDespite the film's heavy subject matter, it is ultimately a testament to the resilience of those who fought against oppression, making I'M STILL HERE not just a film about loss, but also about the strength of the human spirit."", ""Oh my god this movie its so good,The performances are impeccable, and Fernanda Montenegro is an amazing actress. Every moment she's on screen, she shines. Her acting conveys so many emotions with just her gaze. In my opinion, she is the best actress in this film. The competition is tough, as every actor brings their role to life.\n\nThe story is heartbreaking to the point of tears. As someone from Brazil, I deeply understand each subject it tackles, which brings an overwhelming sense of sadness. There are moments in this film when I didn't stand up only because I was in the theater. A well-deserved 10/10, not only for the fantastic acting but also for the heart-wrenching story. It delivers a powerful message about why we can't let this happen again.\n\nBeijão do brazil(Kisses form brazil)"", 'Being Brazilian, it pains me to say the movie disappointed me a little.\n\nOf course we love Fernanda Torres and Selton Mello, which have had good performances, but I was expecting more depth, more interesting script and dialogues, more story. It all felt kind of basic, as if we touched just the surface of everything that happened.\n\nAll this screen time spent with the kids didn\'t add much to the film.\n\nAs a comparison, the Colombian movie ""Memories of my Father"" (2020), which has a similar storyline (the life of a professor and his family during dictatorship) is much more profound, with a thicker plot, and therefore is more memorable.\n\nOn the other hand, this must be one of the best Brazilian movies ever, along with Central do Brasil, Cidade de Deus, o Auto da Compadecida, Tropa de Elite e O Homem que Copiava (and that\'s it).\n\nHaving said all that, I think it\'s worth the watch, for historic knowledge. It has nice cinematography and good production picturing the 70\'s.', ""The movie takes place in Brazil, during the early 70's, when a wife and mother lost her husband, a former local Congressman.\n\nSupposedly, he was killed by the local military, during interrogation about the location of communist guerrillas that were active in Brazil at that time.\n\nDespite the interesting background story, however, the movie is a slow burner, and never really takes off.\n\nThe acting seemed a bit uneven, sometimes giving a soap opera feeling to the scenes, but it's hard to tell whether or not this was on purpose.\n\nHowever it may be, all the hype around this film doesn't seem to make much sense. Not a total waste of time, but it would be quite safe to skip it."", ""One of the best pictures I've seen in years. The Paiva Family brings us the feeling that was hidden by the military governament in Brazil. We can feel the anguish and pain of Eunice that Fernanda Torres bring back to life so brilliantly. Also, the remarkable acting of Fernanda Montenegro as the old Eunice, brings us a feeling of injustice, that even in 2024 is not healed.\n\nThis is movie is really necessary for the Brazilian people who don't lived the dictatorship, and see the risks of being on the same side of the people who agree with this kind of horror. For me, the best chance for Brazilian Cinema in the categories of Best Actress, Best International feature and Best Adapted Screenplay."", ""I don't have words for this movie, you have to see and feel for understand what I am saying.\n\nFernanda's and Selton are one of our best artists in Brazil, this movie mean so much more than all you guys from another country's think.\n\nThe way they filmed this movie is one of my favorites things in the movie too, it's sooooo pretty, it really looks like the movie was filmed in the year that things happen and like when I see the movie in the theaters I literally was crying like a tall child, I never experienced this, the movie touch you in a way that words literally can't explain, it's so pretty and painful. You guys have to watch right now!!"", '""Ainda Estou Aqui"" is a prime example of how a film can be intelligent without resorting to the obvious, visceral without being graphic. Here, Walter Salles delivers a masterclass in the art of exploring horror in a subtle yet powerful way.\n\nFrom the very first minutes, you can tell: this is different. The introduction is superb, with a recreation of 1970s Brazil that feels like it came straight out of Hollywood - impeccable art direction, perfect atmosphere, everything in its place. Then comes the first act. It\'s slow. Not the ""Oh God, when will this end?"" kind of slow, but it does drag a bit. And you know what I liked most about this first act? Director Salles, who was a teenager at the time, weaves in a bunch of pop culture references - music, films, news - giving it a personal, almost nostalgic touch. It\'s clearly drawn from his own experiences and memories.\n\nThe story unfolds linearly but plays heavily with subjectivity. You feel the weight of the narrative without everything being handed to you on a plate. Death, torture, disappearances... It\'s all there, but conveyed through details, silences, and visuals. No heavy-handed exposition or over-explanatory dialogues.\n\nThe acts are well-defined: introduction, event, aftermath, and conclusion. And the best part? The three time skips work brilliantly! No clunky cuts or awkward transitions. Each leap in time pulls you deeper into the story. The neutrality of the narrative is rare: the film simply tells a real story without pointing fingers or pretending to have all the answers.\n\nFernanda Montenegro delivers an emotionally staggering performance without needing words. Through just her gaze and posture, you feel it all: the fear, the anguish, the pain. Honestly, it\'s the kind of acting that puts many international stars to shame.\n\nAnd just when you think it\'s over, the post-credits scene hits. Real photos of those involved, dramatized throughout the film... And the finale? Erasmo Carlos\' song Ainda Estou Aqui wraps it all up beautifully. It gives you chills because it\'s so deeply human.\n\nIn the end, Ainda Estou Aqui is monumental. It\'s genuine Brazilian cinema, the kind that makes you think, ""Finally, we\'ve broken out of the usual mold."" No cheap political gimmicks, no recycling tired formulas. It\'s a mature, powerful work.\n\nRating: 9/10.', ""This is a movie about family, but unfortunately not for all family, because it's about a dictatorship and it's not something to children. But it happened and we cannot forget. It's beautified and sad, light and heavy, all the same times. Because it need to be.\n\nIt's a movie about Brazilian history but not only for Brazilians, because it's about democracy, love, power, resilience, politics, militarism, people, mother, father, children, pets. It is all together. And there is many other stories there, but you will have to watch to notice and understand. The Fernandas were just amazing (as always, but this time, together and forever)."", ""Once the credits start rolling, nobody moves. There's no rushing to get out the door and hit the bathrooms. There's only a loud silence as your mind leaves the immersive experience that is watching this movie. And even as I left, I left hugging my father as we tripped into each other, but not wanting to let go. It makes you realize how easily it is for powerful people to take everything you love and have like it's nothing. It makes you appreciate connection, life, love, family and I hadn't felt that in a while. Fernanda Torres and Selton Mello are intensely charismatic. Amazing performances across the board, even and specially by the child actors. It deserves all the applause possible, specially in times such as the one we're living. Don't take democracy for granted, it's a fragile young thing."", 'Few films can portray with such tenderness an iron era like the Brazilian military dictatorship as ""I\'m Still Here"". With a performance centered on matriarch Eunice Paiva, played by Fernanda Torres, daughter of Oscar nominee Fernanda Montenegro, and one of Brazil\'s most acclaimed actresses, ""I\'m Still Here"" narrates the chain of events that befell the Paiva family after the patriarch was taken to the Doi-Codi - the Brazilian dictatorship\'s military repression division. The film brilliantly adapts the book of the same name by Marcelo Rubens Paiva, Eunice\'s son, who inspired this story. In a raw and moving way, director Walter Salles returns to Brazil in the 1970s to portray the life of a family that had to deal with a sudden disappearance, without answers and in a time of war. The cinematography exudes Rio de Janeiro in its characteristic era, effortlessly conveying the full depth of the Paiva family\'s pain and desolation. Undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.', ""I wish I could say that I enjoyed watching the film.\n\nAnd I say this not because of the film itself, whose acting, editing and sensitivity are impeccable.\n\nThe problem is that there is no way to finish this film without a bitter taste in your mouth, from a story that you know will not have a happy ending, only a less sad one.\n\nThe film is a growing anguish that is only alleviated by the time jumps and the cut that is presented to us. It is impossible to imagine what these and thousands of other families went through.\n\nFinally, it's impressive how Fernanda Montenegro has a strong presence in this film with just one look. It's good to see her again!"", 'A beautiful and necessary film that not only marks a new era in Brazilian cinema, but also marks an important moment in Brazilian history, which must never be forgotten, so that it never happens again. This film not only contemplates in an exquisite manner such a hard and sad part of Brazilian history, but also, without grand pretensions, arrives and shatters any and all possibility of argumentation about an era whose existence is still denied to this day, and which was so violent and unjust to Brazilian society. Moreover, even without intending to, it comes as a possibility of historical reparation for our national cinema, which has not yet been properly recognized. Fabulous Fernanda Torres.', 'All People are saying about this movie is fair! Very touching, emotional. The script is well developed. The acting is perfect, makes you walk on the shoes of the main female character. A must watch! It is worth every minute. It about a mom, a wife, a brazilian during the dictatorship that killed hundreds in Brazil and left many yet missing until today!\n\nIF you can, go to theaters, IF not, watch It on stream with your family! It is a historical and artistic reminder of how tiranny can be cruel, but also how we can be strong and fight against the Power that wants to end with freedom and well being.', ""Besides being a fundamental conversation that needs to be had in Brazil, this is a very powerful and heart-wrenching movie.

Selton Mello is also one of the best actors we have in Brazil nowadays. Everything just so amazing.

The film is powerful, at various moments the emotion is evident and we can feel the pain that the family felt, this happens mainly through the performance of actress Fernanda Torres, a moving performance. It is a fundamental film for understanding what happened during the Brazilian military dictatorship and understanding the importance that democracy and freedom have today.

The story follows the character portrayed by Fernanda Torres, who faces the challenges of living under an oppressive regime and the difficult choices she must make to preserve her dignity and integrity. Directed by Walter Salles, the film clearly captures the political tension of the time, while Torres\' touching performance reflects the pain and resilience of her character. ""I\'m Still Here"" is a deep, thought-provoking drama that touches the soul and encourages reflection on the past and its impact on the present.', ""This movie shows the history no one would ever want for their own country - or, at least, the healthy-mind people.

I'm too young and I lived only the end of those days, but having so many stories near us that are similar to the ones shown, it is just IMPOSSIBLE not to feel sad about all that.\n\nThe movie itself, emotions apart, is a masterpiece.

The mother, played by Fernanda Torres is the emotional pillar and finds strength and courage where she didn't know she was capable of. The story starts in the 70s, it's a period piece and the production is very detailed and honest. Kudos to the director, Water Salles. Amazing work.

Salles\' direction masterfully captures the fragility and fortitude of human connections, crafting a narrative that is both universal and profoundly personal. A testament to the enduring power of hope and perseverance.', ""While I was watching this really passionate and lovely movie, I was wondering if the not Brazilian public will understand, completely, this new hit of our cinema. I doubt it. The movie is about a fear and memorie that only our people can truely be in and that's where the importance of this movie lives in. Walter Salles, through your beautiful direction, remember all the nation how was this devasted recent period of our history that, unfortunately, based in the forgetfulness, is coming back as a shadow that insists to be against our young democracy. Anyway, all the performeces are breathtaking, but Fernanda Torres is the real star here, maybe I was just expecting a scene that would blow my mind. However, that's not the purpose of the film, that is to show to all the world the power and perseverance of this strong woman named Eunice Paiva. Last but not least, I know the movie is about a particularly story, however, I can't see a movie about the Brazilian reality and past that don't talk a little bit about the structural inequality that makes our country.

Directed by Halina Reijn, the film dives deep into the complexities of human desire and power dynamics, wrapped in an intense, almost suffocating atmosphere.\n\nFirst off, the visuals are stunning. The cinematography by Jasper Wolf captures the raw emotion of each scene, blending light and shadow to create a moody, almost dreamlike world. There's a constant feeling of tension, as if something explosive is always on the verge of happening, and the pacing keeps you on edge throughout.\n\nNicole Kidman delivers an amazing performance, bringing a mix of vulnerability and cold calculation to her character. The supporting cast, though lesser-known, does a great job too, giving the story depth and unpredictability. Without giving too much away, the film's exploration of psychological control and submission feels both disturbing and mesmerizing.\n\nThat said, Babygirl is not for everyone. Its erotic elements are tastefully done but can feel uncomfortable or controversial for some viewers. The storyline at times feels intentionally vague, forcing you to piece together the characters' motivations, which I found intriguing but might frustrate others.\n\nOverall, if you're into psychological thrillers that don't shy away from taboo subjects and push the envelope, Babygirl is definitely worth the watch. It's haunting, stylish, and will leave you thinking about it long after the credits roll."", ""What really carries this film are the two excellent central performances from Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson. Without them, this film would be entirely forgettable, particularly because this film doesn't really break new ground in its genre and the plot is thin. Sophie Wilde and Antonio Banderas are also good in their supporting roles. Kidman is great in portraying a woman who wants to sink into her desires, but is constantly conflicted in doing so.\n\nThe score, soundtrack, atmosphere, the costumes Kidman wears, and cinematography all really elevate this film. The film feels very cold and aloof, which is in keeping with our protagonist. As alluded to earlier, the film's biggest issue is that the story is tenuous and not really anything new. It's surprisingly tame for what it is. It almost felt like the film was self-conscious and scared to really go there and be prurient. But perhaps that was intentional, to mirror Romy's reluctance to go there herself. While there is some nudity, it never really feels sexy. Perhaps that was the director's intent though. While sex scenes in erotic thrillers tend to be sexy, passionate, salacious, almost fantastical, the sex scenes in this film feel very organic, and even awkward at times. Between Romy and Samuel there are awkward silences, confusion as to what to do next, insecurity about intimacy. The result is that you feel like a fly on the wall. However, as a viewer, that is both positive and negative. Positive because it feels realistic, perhaps relatable. But negative because much of the film is difficult to watch. What really would have elevated this film is fleshing out Romy's past and her dark desires. A small nitpick I had with the film is regarding Dickinson's tattoos. It felt like he was a walking bad boy stereotype with all the tattoos he had.\n\nThat being said, the film is worth checking out, if only for the great acting."", 'It\'s a drama about sexual fantasy and control set in December in modern New York City. The family in question is 50-ish high-powered executive Romy Mathis (Nicole Kidman), her Broadway play director husband, Jacob (Antonio Banderas), and their two teenage daughters, Isabel (Esther McGregor) and Nora (Vaughan Reilly). Romy is highly successful and innovative at her job but sexually unsatisfied in her marriage.\n\nRomy meets Samuel (Harris Dickinson), a 25-ish intern at her company, who she is attracted to because of his assertive behavior. His behavior and her fantasies collide in a relationship with predictable problems, including Samuel also dating Romy\'s assistant, Esme (Sophie Wilde). After things get out of control, there is climactic conflict and resolution.\n\n""Babygirl"" is a virtuoso Nicole Kidman performance. That\'s the best that I can say for the film. Harris Dickinson is adequate as a manipulative jerk, as is Antonio Banderas as a preoccupied husband. Esther McGregor has a nice little subplot in the film. ""Babygirl"" is no feminist movie, and there are no attractive characters. The film\'s ending is superficial and ludicrous. The cinematography is creative at points, and the sex scenes are not graphic. However, any ""truth"" in ""Babygirl"" is lost in the unrealistic ending.', 'Sick Shyt. That\'s the vibe this movie radiates from start to finish. The storyline feels like it\'s trying to shock its audience, but instead, it lands firmly in the realm of cringe. Despite Nicole Kidman\'s undeniable talent, even her presence can\'t salvage this mess of a film. The narrative feels forced, lacking the subtlety or depth needed to tackle the themes it ambitiously bites off but can\'t chew.\n\nThe ""low-class vibe"" isn\'t edgy or provocative-it\'s just sloppy. The characters fail to resonate, and the power dynamics, which could have been compelling, come across as cheap and uncomfortable. Shame on whoever thought this was a good idea to bring to the screen-or maybe not, because it\'s hard to tell if this was intentional or just a colossal misstep.\n\nUltimately, Babygirl feels like an awkward, misguided attempt at being daring, but it just ends up being exactly what it tries not to be: a cringeworthy, low-grade story that misses the mark.', ""This film is really different from other love affairs between young girls and young girls this year. The focus is not on having an affair with a young girl, but on the heroine as a middle-aged person trying to explore her long-standing sexual fantasies and struggling with whether to face the reality. Self, or suppressing and covering up the need to be a normal person. Because what she likes is not young meat, but alternative sexual fetishes. Moreover, in several other old-young romances, the woman is single (widowed or divorced). The purpose is to avoid moral condemnation and just to please the female audience, so they are all presented in the form of romantic comedies. But this film deals with ethics such as cheating and inappropriate behavior in the workplace, and emphasizes the heroine's inner condemnation, shame, and desire to stop. Therefore, it is no longer a comedy or fantasy, but is presented in a suspense-thriller manner, and it explores not love but self-awareness."", 'Maybe if young actor Harrison Dickinson didn\'t play such a smug, arrogant creep, it would be easier to believe Nichole Kidman\'s character could instantly develop such a dangerous attraction to him in the new erotic thriller ""Babygirl."" And maybe if there weren\'t a real person named Luigi Mangione seducing millions of social media followers with a similar posture of sexy entitlement as he faces murder charges for a cold-blooded killing, it would be easier to dismiss this kinky drama written and directed by Halina Reijn as pure fantasy.\n\nEither way, the movie is pretty much of a mess.\n\nIt\'s getting a bit of buzz at the moment for Kidman\'s recent Golden Globe nomination, and for the - gasp - lengths she went to to earn it.\n\nIn case you\'ve missed the sizzling ad campaigns, ""Babygirl"" opens with an apparently nude Nicole testing the limits of R-ratings in the throes of passionate lovemaking with her husband (Antonio Banderas). As though that\'s not steamy enough, she finishes up with a kinky encore orgasm in front of her computer screen.\n\nAll this before the opening credits, and the scenes establishing her character Romy Mathis as the founder and CEO of a cutting-edge company that\'s streamlining Amazon-style commerce with robotics.\n\nWith her successful playwright husband, two beautiful teenage daughters, a corner office with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Manhattan skyline, a penthouse and a mansion in the country, Romy\'s got it all. And she rules her domain with aloof, absolute control.\n\nAt least until the intern shows up.\n\nHis name is Samuel (Dickinson) and they meet by accident when he saves her from a savage German Shepherd attack on the sidewalk in front of her office. Later that morning she is formally introduced to the dog whisperer as a member of her company\'s incoming class of interns.\n\nSamuel stands out of the crowd - at 6-foot-2 he towers over them, actually - but this doesn\'t explain why Romy can\'t keep her eyes off the condescending sneer usually on his face. He makes his disregard for her authority clear from the get-go, with the kind of attitude that would a guy fired, pronto, in any corporate setting in anyplace remotely resembling the real world.\n\nInstead, Romy chooses to risk everything she has created and built in her corporate empire and perfect family to get him to practice some of that dog whispering on her.\n\nWhat follows is lots, and lots, of seedy hotel rooms, office desk tops and even a rave, for her to keep discovering how low can she go. Turns out she was faking it in her perfect world. This young-enough-to-be-her-son lover is offering her a way out ... she thinks, and she\'s willing to commit career suicide to prove it.\n\nLast year Emma Stone won the Oscar and a Golden Globe for her bold foray into sexuality in the brilliant ""Poor Things."" She made sex mainstream for awards season.\n\nKidman gets points for guts for following Emma\'s lead, and for still having an if-you\'ve-got-it-flaunt-it body in her late 50s. But she still comes in a distant second to Stone\'s groundbreaking performance, which sealed the deal with a healthy sense of humor on the whole subject of sex.\n\nBesides the corporate backstabbing and snake pit treachery, there are themes of fragile family dynamics along with Romy seriously twisted psyche in ""Babygirl."" But that\'s not what the audience has come to see.\n\nUnfortunately, for those of us who never got the concept of power as an aphrodisiac, or are color-blind when it comes to differentiating 50 shades of gray, Reijn\'s screenplay doesn\'t make much sense. The eroticism the publicists are banking on gets tedious in a hurry, and would be of even less interest if it weren\'t Nicole Kidman up there, baring it almost all.\n\nShe remains one of the most versatile actresses on screen today, but ""Babygirl"" is at best a sideways step rather than a thrilling advance in her brilliant career.', ""Watched at venice movie festival in sala grande with the cast.\n\nThe movie is thrilling and audacius with a good soundtrack, and great performances by Nicole Kidman, Antonio Banderas (he has some truly good moments) and Harris Dickinson. I think the scripts starts quiet ordinary but it becomes then more and more interesting with a final take on sexuality and women which is truly remarkable. Halina Reijin is also a skilled director who also put in this movie an incredible club scene (one of the best club scene I have ever seen in my life, it was like she wants the all audience in Venice to bring out the inner hidden animal). Also Kidman obviusly commands the entire movie with a performance that I am sure will be always remembered\n\nProbabnly the movie will be released during Christimas and I can just say it's totally right :)"", ""My wife and I saw Babygirl (2024) in theaters this evening. The storyline centers on a New York CEO married to a Broadway play director. She harbors a deep, dark sexual urge that her husband cannot satisfy. When an interim employee joins her company, he notices something about her, and she notices him-setting the stage for her darkest desires to be fulfilled.\n\nThis film is written and directed by Halina Reijn (Bodies Bodies Bodies) and stars Nicole Kidman (Cold Mountain), Harris Dickinson (County Lines), Antonio Banderas (The 13th Warrior), Sophie Wilde (Talk to Me), and Esther McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi).\n\nThis is a unique and well-crafted film. It explores intriguing intricacies surrounding unfulfilled desires, highlighting how they can consume a person when finally realized, becoming as addictive and destructive as a drug. Kidman delivers an elite performance, portraying her character's internal struggles with nuance and depth. The storyline is smart, with indirect analogies to AI and the complexities of the human mind adding layers of thoughtfulness. The cinematography, wardrobe, and settings are exceptional, fully immersing the viewer in the film's world. While not flawless, there's much to appreciate here.\n\nIn conclusion, Babygirl is an artistically crafted and executed film that will likely receive award recognition. I'd score it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it at least once."", 'There are so many movies like ""Babygirl"" that don\'t understand the emotion behind things like infidelity, power, and lust, using them as devices instead of primal aspects of the human condition. When one is done this well, it feels like a bolt of lightning.\n\nReijn is unafraid to have her characters play out all the wobbles that come with negotiating one another\'s boundaries, reinforcing how pleasure comes from good communication. That the Dutch female director manages to do so while crafting some of the hottest sex scenes in a major film in years and without dropping the ball in pacing this satire on the era of the politically correct feels almost impossible.\n\nBabygirl is that movie and most likely because it\'s subject matter is written from a female perspective.', 'This is the biggest cringe-fest I have seen in ages. I expected something at least interesting or sexy. Yuck...there is no sexiness to be found here. There is zero chemistry between Nicole Kidman and the young dude, no proper build up to their relationship or whatever the hell it is, and the director appears clueless as to what she\'s making.\n\nThe best part of the whole damn movie is when the daughter asks Kidman why she puts that crap in her face because she looks like a dead fish because it\'s what we all really want to know. Why is she doing this to her face? Does she think it looks good? It looks ridiculous and the weird unnatural face is very distracting on a big screen.\n\nThe dead, unmoving ""fish face"" has taken away her previous acting abilities and she\'s completely flat here. Her face is expressionless, even as hard as she\'s trying (and she\'s trying hard), but the 800 units of Botox and 30 syringes of filler is hard to defeat. She looks embalmed, and on top of it her breasts look like two hard rocks. Why is she continuing to play these supposed ""sexy"" parts? Nicole, you look like a plastic grandma please just stop. It\'s becoming stomach churning.\n\nBut nothing in the entire film is as stomach churning as Samuel\'s ""dance"" to George Michael\'s Father Figure. Seriously? I\'m still trying to recover from the cringe. What sort of dance moves are those? Is this supposed to be sexy? Who are the people who find this sexy?\n\nI haven\'t been this irritated by a movie in quite some time. This is the crap that is going to put theaters out of business. Save your money and watch the trailer because there is nothing more to see and a whole lot you will wish you hadn\'t seen.', ""I would love to heap praise on this movie, but much of what makes it exceptional is tied to moments and details I wouldn't want to spoil. That said, I can say this: it's a rare example of an erotic film where the sex scenes are deeply character-driven, not gratuitous indulgences designed for the director's satisfaction.\n\nThis film is mature, intelligent, and daring, operating on a level that respects the audience's ability to think and feel deeply. Unlike the melodramatic thrillers we often associate with eroticism, such as Fatal Attraction, this movie offers a refreshingly realistic exploration of sexuality-one that acknowledges its profound complexity.\n\nDesire is rarely straightforward. Our passions and kinks often defy easy explanation, arising from parts of ourselves we may not fully understand. Yet, we feel them with undeniable force. For once, here is a film that gets it-one that portrays the messiness of human intimacy without reducing it to a spectacle or a simplistic morality tale.\n\nThis is a story that understands its subject on a visceral level, offering a nuanced, unflinching portrayal of the way sexuality weaves through our lives. It's a film that challenges, excites, and provokes thoughtful reflection-something that is all too rare in this genre."", 'When an older woman does it she is seen as ""chic"" and ""liberated."" As someone else pointed out on here, what\'s with the hypocrisy and double standard.\n\nThis storyline is becoming real tiresome, but if they want to keep pushing it, then call it what it is. A dirty old woman looking to validate herself by nabbing a younger man. To prove to herself she is still worthy. I mean, that\'s what women have said about men in the same situation.\n\nHaven\'t we also heard for years that actresses who age are aging out of so many movies (""unfairly"") by comparison to older actors who can still get great roles.\n\nHardly. In fact, there are a lot of great roles for older actresses.\n\nBut why do so many have to do with this theme of hooking up with a much younger man.\n\nSurely there are better parts for women out there that have some substance rather than dummying down to this same old trope.\n\nLet\'s see some creativity in storytelling. Let\'s see some storylines where some of our great, older actresses are cast, but there isn\'t yet another young man involved.\n\nWe need to see women empowered through their skills and offerings as successful women. Not just their attempts at validating themselves with younger men.', ""They REALLY should have had a warning. There is one scene that makes anyone nauseated with the strobing. The scene lasted about a minute, and was extremely stimulating. The film itself was erotic and strange, and a lot of gasps/shocked laughs in the theatre. The main male character was salacious and Kidman was good with her role of bored, submissive CEO. The film itself was half-baked, but the sex scenes were done tastefully. I wish I knew more about all of the characters, as they were all surface level. Also, I definitely wouldn't consider this a thriller. I was waiting for the other shoe to drop, but it never did. Left a lot to be desired."", ""Nicole Kidman delivers an inspiring performance as the titular Babygirl, but the movie overall falters in its execution. The premise is compelling and provocative, but the narrative feels underdeveloped and disjointed. The sexual connection between Kidman's and Harris Dickinson's characters lacks clarity, and Antonio Banderas' role is completely mishandled, leaving his character feeling irrelevant. The film's minimal exposition leaves logical gaps between scenes. Despite these flaws, the film earns points for ambition and its strong lead performance, but the overall experience falls short of its potential."", ""The movie was good at conveying their point about the consequences of repressed desires and how shame and social expectations can cause it especially in older women who were socialized to be that way. The writer-director Halina Reijn said that this movie was like a response to Eyes Wide Shut and she was right. The main difference is that IN MY OPINION Babygirl is 1000% better. Were there parts that I wished could have been fleshed out more? Yes, but it is an A24 movie so they had to work within the budget. While the movie is about sex, there's not much nudity and the sex scenes weren't overdone and overdramatized like it was in Eyes Wide Shut. Also it's not really a D/s movie and it wasn't supposed to be. If you're expecting this movie to completely bridge the orgasm gap between women and men, it won't because it's a movie that STARTS the conversation about it. This film was purposely marketed as an psychosexual erotic thriller so if you're ADVERSE to movies with that GLARING tagline then don't watch it."", 'In keeping with a recent trend wherein longtime female A-listers make boldly erotic provocative performances - as with Emma Stone in Poor Things, and Demi Moore in The Substance - critics have, rightly or wrongly, consistently lauded these performances with high acclaim.\n\nMost obviously evocative of Fifty Shades of Grey - yet in my estimation not nearly as cringeworthy - as well as Disclosure, Basic Instinct, The Boy Next Door, and sharing plot points with the shamelessly low-brow Lifetime movie Psycho Intern, the movie, thankfully, remains supremely intelligent without going campy or murderous.\n\nWhile others have suggested Nicole Kidman has made a career of unsettling roles, I must say this one is perhaps the most daring and unsettling - more so than we\'ve ever seen Nicole Kidman before.\n\nRooted in eroticism, power dynamics, and in all likelihood childhood traumas, the movie relies on a massive amount of nuance in every interaction and conversation - both in the workplace and interpersonally - and repeatedly begs the question... ""Who actually has the power here?""\n\nAntonio Banderas, who appears in the movie for good measure, early on comes across as merely a prop and a generic unfulfilling husband. It is only in the final act that his veteran acting chops are put to good use.\n\nAs the movie wound down to a conclusion, I did start to feel that there could be no ending that could reasonably be satisfying. And, frankly, to that point, one could make the argument that the movie did in fact end a little too ""neat"" and convenient. But I won\'t let this takeaway from Kidman\'s performance and the thought-provoking emotional conflicts throughout.', ""There is something odd and unique about Nicole Kidman doing risqué sexual fantasy films with the theme of Old Cougar/ Mrs Robinson seducing young boys is getting repetitive - yet this one is a bit more 9 1/2 weeks with some unique themes borderline soft porn for most viewers but there is some tidbits of healthy/ unhealthy pseudo sexual modern exploration.\n\nThe acting is decent by Kidman and Banderas but the young kid was not very convincing and needs to learn some better erotic dance moves.\n\nThe plot and theme was hard to find believable and the boy kid could easily have involved an older hunk or a sex therapist closer to Kidman age to provide more depth and meaning - instead we are led to believe that a juvenile kid /intern 20s has mastered the power/ domination expertise without much explanation or character development besides knowing how to control a powerful old women like a dog.\n\nIs this really the new stage for power Feminism is woman of power need young boys to dominate them. ??\n\nA sad commentary on modern feminism yet the kink and sex themes are a unique modern perspective that most might equate with soft porn exploitation rather than a deeper individual sexual and childhood exploration/ neurosis.\n\nRegardless it is a rather bold and complex issue to explore in modern cinema perhaps a bit too avant garde and kudos to the writer/ director to get Kidman and Banderas to participate.\n\nThe ending is a bit tame and lame yet it tries to bring a safe resolution to a very complex issue that basically is sending out a message that a power CEO cheating on her husband is somehow acceptable if the husband gets to play along and evolve in her sex fantasy world.\n\nI'm very curious what this writer/ director next project explores .... definitely a raw talent\n\n6 stars for the acting, music but script was lacking."", ""'Babygirl' asks too much of its audience. We're asked to believe in Nicole Kidman's character Romy as the CEO of a Robotics firm. We're asked to believe in a CEO who spends no time in the office and all her time making love with an intern. We're asked to believe in - not love at first sight - but eager submissiveness at first sight. As well as the reverse; a young character played by Harrison Dickenson knowing at first sight that he can dominate another (one who just happens to be his CEO). Too much. So much that these 'asks' bothered me even in many of the film's most sexually adventurous interludes. And that's saying a lot.\n\nThe film is all about sexual gratification; two characters who need the playing out of power and submission to truly get off. As Kidman's character tells her husband of nineteen years (Antonio Banderas), With you I've never had an orgasm.\n\nWell she certainly does 'get off' with Dickenson, and I have to say that Kidman's performance during these scenes was truly riveting. Despite what I wrote above, there were instances when Kidman's transformation into a helpless young woman, or an ecstatic recipient of pleasure, left me totally engaged.\n\nThe film has a sub-plot which for me did not work. Something about women in the workplace; how they should be promoted more widely, and protected more vigorously. There is the office creep who tries to take advantage of Kidman's situation, as well as the office-climber who does the same.\n\nHarris Dickenson is cold and dangerous in his role as the all-powerful. There is in his eyes a willingness - I thought - to push all the emotional / erotic buttons. A coldness with nothing more at stake than holding power. He cares nothing about professional advancement for himself, he just wants blind submission. And gets it.\n\nAs for the film's ending, it was - for me - something of a surprise.

Her chemistry with Harris was remarkable; every scene felt like a shifting balance of power between them, moving from strength to vulnerability and back again.

She captures the vulnerability and strength of a woman in a way that is both raw and beautiful.

I was aware of the premise of the movie before seeing this, and all I can tell you is that the way the premise played out on the screen lacked any and all credibility. The longer I watched this, the less I was interested in it. Nicole ""Ice Queen"" Kidman tries her best. Up-and-coming English actor Harris Dickinson is utterly mismatched. I saw no chemistry between these two, and it all felt so... staged. I was incredibly disappointed, to the point where I literally walked out of the theater halfway through the movie. I have to admit that I have read a number of reviews, many quite positive, and I just could not match it up with my own personal viewing experience of this.\n\n""Babygirl"" premiered at the Venice Film Festival to good acclaim, and in particular Nicole Kidman\'s performance has generated potential buzz at the upcoming awards season. If you are in the mood for a supposed ""erotic thriller"" or simply are a fan of Nicole Kidman, I\'d suggest you check it out, and draw your own conclusion. For me ""Babygirl"" is one of the worst movies of 2024.', 'Magnificent story about relationships between people shown from a winde variety of interesting perspectives and dimensions ... it also contains an important message about the importance of exploring your sexuality through self reflection and meaningful conversations about the deeper source of sensuality and erotic connection ; where does it all come from and how should I deal with it? Also it shows how important it is to be opened up to change ... without changing your sexual perspectives there will never be improvement ... a true gem of a movie ; if only more movie scripts were this interesting and intriguing, this World would be a much better place for everyone ...', ""This is not the movie I was hoping for. It felt awkward at times, with cringe worthy scenes. As much as I enjoyed Nicole Kidman, Harris Dickinson was not enjoyable for me on screen. I felt like it could have been sexier, and more kink satisfying. I literally laughed at some scenes when I should have enjoyed them. A theme I'm into, but this wasn't it for me. Antonio Banderas was a perfect fit for the part! You felt for the husband, and i bought his pain. I really wish this would have been better, but as it is, I don't think I'd care to ever watch it again.\n\nSaw in theaters at AMC with Nicole on 12-27-2024."", ""Babygirl pushes boundaries of sexism and individuality further than what i've seen on film in a long time. Due to Kidman's powerhouse career-best performance, She IS Babygirl. She fully embraces and becomes her character. She acts as if she's not on camera and captures a true in depth performance with vulnerability like we've never seen on screen before. Dickinson proves a lot with his subtle yet thought provoking portrayal of Samuel. Halina writes a clever script with dialogue that moves this conversation concerning sex and desire in a new direction. The ending is unexpected and a nice touch to this piece on feminism and power dynamics. While I think this is a highlight of the year in film, I think the story could have gone further in detail than it did with its amount of screen time. I believe this is worth a focused watch and will be an acting masterclass for actors watching."", 'In the genre of ""erotic thriller"" it is typically the male that is portrayed as the cheating spouse who gets caught up with the femme fatale.\n\nHere, the role is reversed... it\'s the middle-aged career woman seeking sexual satisfaction outside her marriage with a younger co-worker.\n\nDespite what some reviews here suggest though, this is not an audacious concept. It has been mined in such movies as Unfaithful and Ryan\'s Daughter.\n\nAnd for a movie being marketed as an erotic thriller/mystery, there\'s none of that here. It\'s just a straight up drama more in the vein of 9-1/2 Weeks than movies such as Fatal Attraction or Body Heat.\n\nThere\'s a hint of what could have been in just one scene where Kidman\'s philandering corporate officer and her younger lover threaten each other with exposure. Which of them has the better ammo? We\'ll never know because the subject is never broached again.\n\nKidman deserves nods for leaning hard into her role as the unsatisfied wife who has kept a lid on her darker desires during the course of her marriage. Unfortunately, the younger man she takes on, Harris Dickinson, is no match for her. He doesn\'t have the gravitas or screen presence to suggest that Kidman\'s character would be at all interested in him.\n\nAn okay one-of watch for Kidman\'s performance.', 'Nicole Kidman delivers a fearless performance in Babygirl, a candid tale of lust, power dynamics, and control. The film explores the complexities of female sexuality and the disarray that arises when defining one\'s needs. Halina Reijn\'s direction channels the spirit of classic erotic thrillers like Unfaithful and 9½ Weeks, but with an up-to-the-minute corporate twist that is both humane and insightful.\n\nNicole Kidman is fearless in this brutally candid exploration of lust and power\n\nOne of the many reasons that sex scenes in movies have faded as a phenomenon is the omnipresence of pornography. When people can easily click on their deepest kinks and favored objects of desire, who needs a carefully staged R-rated ""erotic"" version?\n\nAs if to acknowledge this, Babygirl, a drama about a dangerous office liaison written and directed by Halina Reijn (Bodies Bodies Bodies), opens with a high-angle close-up of Nicole Kidman straddling an unseen man, panting with pleasure. It looks and sounds like the kind of movie sex scene that once would have been described as ""hot."" But as soon as the coupling is over, and the man-Antonio Banderas, as Kidman\'s husband-says ""I love you,"" we see Kidman slip into another room (easy to do in their spacious Manhattan apartment), where she lies on the floor in front of her laptop and masturbates to a grungy piece of incest porn.\n\nThe irony here is that Kidman\'s character, Romy, is presented as a woman who ""has it all."" She\'s the CEO of her own company-an e-commerce outfit called Tensile Automation, akin to a next-level Amazon that promises one-day delivery using automated logistics (i.e., robots run the entire warehouse). She has a caring, supportive husband, who\'s a prominent New York theater director, and two vibrant teenage daughters (Esther McGregor and Vaughan Reilly). And she has a ""healthy"" sex life-but also secret transgressive fantasies, which are what really get her off. In other words, she has it all; she just doesn\'t have it all in one place.\n\nEarly on, we see Romy in the office, presenting mission-statement videos for the company, where every upbeat word is market-tested, including a reference to how ""nurturing"" the company is-despite its all-robot premise effectively putting people out of work. Romy rationalizes it as liberating people from menial jobs. This sly take on corporate culture today connects directly to Romy\'s pent-up sexuality and the forbidden office hookup about to ensnare her.\n\nRomy, with her ""friendly"" professional demeanor and eyes glued to the constant information stream of her phone, is the quintessential boss as highly functional control freak. Underneath it all, she craves a kind of sexuality that breaks apart that control. The implication of Babygirl is that it isn\'t just Romy-it\'s a societal issue. We are increasingly rooted in technology and corporate routines, where everything is controlled, feeding a desire to break free.\n\nEnter Samuel (Harris Dickinson), one of the company\'s new interns. The young man who ignites Romy\'s fantasies is much younger-a work colleague barely out of college. Had Babygirl been made 20 years ago, it might have been conceived as a ""cougar"" fantasy, centered on animal magnetism. Instead, Reijn crafts a far shrewder narrative.\n\nThe two meet when the interns are given a tour of Tensile\'s sprawling lower Broadway office suite. During the introduction, Samuel asks Romy an incredibly blunt question about the company\'s robot premise. Dickinson, the gifted actor from The Iron Claw and Triangle of Sadness, has a blunt-edged charm reminiscent of a young Austin Butler. Samuel\'s message to Romy is clear: ""I make the rules by breaking yours."" Their chemistry is not about attraction-it\'s about the thrill of transgression. Every time Samuel sees Romy, he hits her with another casually hostile negging remark. His ""flirting"" is an aggressive assault, and that\'s precisely why she can\'t resist it.\n\nBabygirl becomes a shrewdly honest and engaging depiction of a ""wrong"" sadomasochistic affair. Unlike her previous film Bodies Bodies Bodies, which leaned into satirical slasher pulp, Reijn here embraces a more realistic tone. The film feels reminiscent of Fair Play but with the emotional resonance of Unfaithful. Nicole Kidman\'s fearless performance is at the core of what makes this movie work.\n\nStraddling the identities of mother, boss, adulterer, and submissive, Kidman\'s Romy embodies complexity, much like a walking mood ring. Her character draws on a hidden truth-people in positions of power often fantasize about submission. While prominent male executives have been stereotypically linked to BDSM fantasies, we rarely see a corporate woman portrayed in the same light. Babygirl turns the gender tables, evoking comparisons to 9½ Weeks as Samuel gradually breaks down Romy\'s defenses. In one key scene, he sends her a glass of milk during after-work drinks, declaring, ""You\'re my baby girl."" And when she drinks it, she silently affirms, ""Yes, I am.""\n\nIn their hotel room meetings, Kidman oscillates between submission and resistance, and the emotions playing across her face are nothing short of astonishing. She lets us witness the erotic battle tearing Romy apart. The true danger, however, isn\'t the S&M kink-it\'s the breaking of every corporate rule governing workplace relationships. Samuel exploits these corporate protocols, using them to seduce Romy. The fact that she\'s risking her entire career by having an affair with an intern only adds to the allure. Kidman\'s genius lies in portraying this recklessness as utterly human-the desperate expression of a woman too compartmentalized to reconcile the different parts of herself.\n\nDoes it all come crashing down? Babygirl follows a more conventional trajectory in some aspects (including one memorable eye-candy moment, where Samuel dances to George Michael\'s ""Father Figure""). But one of the film\'s strengths is avoiding the roller-coaster final act expected of an ""erotic thriller."" Instead of moralizing in the vein of Fatal Attraction, Reijn aims to liberate characters already busy punishing themselves. The film takes unexpected turns, and that\'s because its ambition goes beyond fueling the thriller-it seeks to authentically depict women\'s erotic experiences in an age of control.', ""A pretty good movie. It keeps you engaged and on your toes. The only thing that needs some work is more chemistry between Romy and Samuel, and also more sex scenes! I mean the movie had a pretty good amount of raunchy scenes, but I felt it wasn't raunchy enough. Too much foreplay and building the tension without enough climax between the two main characters. The acting was good and the storyline was also good. Not a lot of heavy bdsm stuff in this movie, it's pretty light play but that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie. I also wish they took the relationship between Romy and Samuel deeper, I just felt like something was lacking..."", ""Babygirl is a bit messy, yet it's sexy nature, character dynamics, direction and strong performances from Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickenson pulls into the center of humiliation, desires, control, and empowerment.\n\nHalina Reijn's direction remains strong on capturing the essence of it's setting and nature. Powered with interesting themes and character dynamics between each other. Alongside with good production designs and camerawork. Narrative wise, the story is a bit predictable. Because stories like this aren't new and it did drag some moments and my connection with the characters aren't fully invested as I would have hoped for. But I do appreciate some of the new concepts and ideas it did explore. The ideas of hypocrisy and double standard are explored solidly.\n\nOverall, it seems A24 is going for more popular standard concepts recently which I am happy for them being able to spread out for wider audiences. I recommend this for a good erotic thriller, just not something that I say is amazing."", ""We have seen this movie done many times, and done so much better. That is the most infuriating thing. This story can be done right with emotion, sensuality, and intensity. This had none of that. What it lacked the most and its biggest downfall; it had zero believability. None with the characters, the plot, or the backstory. There is just one person in this entire journey that you feel for, and you feel for him because of the only decent performance worth mentioning. And even he gets shafted with a horrible story arch before it is all said and done.\n\nThe foundation was intriguing. A brilliant, married, business woman with past drama starts a lurid affair with a young intern. Lifetime built an entire channel around that premise. Nicole Kidman as the lead is also excitable. She is a beautiful, seasoned actress who exudes power. But mother of pearl inlay this was just a squandered use of all of those building blocks.\n\nBaby Girl's story, though understandable, is ultra thin. We get a small glimpse as to how Romy (Nicole Kidman) rose to heights in the business world. It is fuzzy who does what at the company and what if anything takes place there. They bring in a new group of interns including a pompous, mouthy, brat named Samuel (Harris Dickinson). He immediately picks up on Romy's kinks and uses them to somehow manipulate her into risking everything. By this point in the film it is established that Romy has some serious issues when it comes to sex. Either from her past - which is touched on but never really explained - or trying to deal with her powerful position.\n\nThe chemistry between Kidman and Dickinson is void of any sort of magic or allure. We simply do not believe it. And when scenes such as what we get in this movie which live and breath on chemistry, when it is not there, it just becomes sad and laughable. Samuel comes off as a spoiled punk and you sort of hate him from the jump. That makes it even harder to believe that Romy would be the least bit interested in this guy; kink or no kink. She could find better on Google.\n\nAt the heart of this is also Romy's husband (Jacob) Antonio Banderas. Jacob is a loving, patient, caring man who tries his best to understand and come along side Romy. There is no doubt that they have intimacy issues but you get the feeling that they are pushed dwon instead of talked about. Even as he finds out about the affair he is fair and reacts as expected. Banderas is the one person in this film actor and character I could have empathy for. (Side note) - If you get tired of the movie and want to find a way to entertain yourself. Just close your eyes. All the scenes with Banderas now feel like a Puss N Boots movie.\n\nThe biggest disappointment and shocker is that the film is written and directed by a woman. Halina Reijn is a capable film maker on both sides of the camera. If anyone should be able to convey what she wants Romy to convey it is her. If a guy made this film I would get the disconnect. I would tell him to stop trying to get inside a woman's head about these things. But here there is no excuse for what we get from the story and performances.\n\nBaby Girl is rated R for strong sexual content, nudity and language. Even before the first scene comes into focus you know what this movie is about. Make sure you are comfortable with who you are seeing it with, and that you are both mature enough not to giggle during the sexy scenes.\n\nI give it one star because zero stars might look like I forgot to add any."", 'Nicole Kidman has received rave reviews for her complex portrayal of a business leader with some extreme personality traits. The film feel modern and complex. It is edgy in terms of focusing on her personal fantasies. She puts it all out there, which the Oscars may like. The BEST thing about the film may be the great use of music. Great song use from INXS and George Michael. In addition the film is well-written and well produced, but NOT for the family, 18+ and don\'t bring sensitive people to see it. The only real complaint here is that there are a few overly dramatic scenes where the interaction does not seem possible. Most of these include her love interest. He\'s a 28 year old ""intern."" I\'ve never seen that. But there are some edge of your seat moments that make this feel like a thriller at times. Her 15-year old daughter is portrayed as being unreasonably older in her thinking and actions. Antonio Banderas is a solid as the husband. The young guy, Harris Dickerson is a good actor, but sometimes just too cheesy. I am curious to see if he does the the role in the upcoming Beatles biopic. He does look enough like John Lennon to pull it off. Overall 7.5/10.', ""Babygirl is written and directed by Halina Reijn. This is Halina Reijn's third directorial venture, Babygirl, sees her once again step behind the camera, bringing an ambitious psychological drama to life. Starring Nicole Kidman as Romy, alongside Harris Dickinson as Samuel and Antonio Banderas, the film delves into themes of self-image, power, and psychological manipulation. While the setup hints at a strong female-driven narrative, Babygirl struggles to find its footing, falling short of its potential as a gripping thriller.\n\nThe opening act establishes Romy as an enigmatic, highly accomplished woman grappling with her own inner demons. Nicole Kidman delivers a nuanced performance, perfectly embodying Romy's external perfection and internal conflict. However, this initial exploration feels overly drawn out, leaning heavily on exposition rather than action. While it provides a foundation for Romy's character, the pacing falters, making it difficult to stay engaged.\n\nThe middle section aims to build the relationship between Romy and Samuel, her younger and seemingly manipulative partner. Harris Dickinson portrays Samuel with an unsettling charm, and the pair's mind games add intrigue but fail to sustain momentum. The film repeatedly falls back on surface-level provocations, particularly sexual tension, which feels excessive rather than illuminating.\n\nFinally, the last act delivers the tension promised by the film's premise, albeit not entirely in the way one might hope. The stakes rise on a personal level for Romy, and Reijn successfully heightens the emotional intensity. However, the lack of focus on her professional life-hinted as a critical aspect of her identity-undermines the broader tension. The corporate drama, which could have provided another dimension of stakes and conflict, is conspicuously absent.\n\nIn conclusion, Babygirl is a film that may appeal to those seeking a slow-burn psychological character study. However, viewers expecting an intense, tightly-knit thriller with far-reaching consequences may walk away disappointed."", ""This movie was a very pleasant surprise. I went in without any clue of what to expect, so I had no idea what was going to happen next. That said, I wouldn't mind watching it again to enjoy the story and performances even more now that I know the plot and ending. The writing is generally solid and I like how real the whole drama felt. Writer-director Halina Reijn gives a new take to what is not a fresh subject matter. Both Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson are impressive and carry their roles confidently. The music scoring is also very effective which added to making this movie a very gripping entertainment."", 'A fascinating sexual thriller of recent years, it attracts attention with its unique love dynamics: the woman is older than the man by as much as 30 years. At the time of filming, Nicole Kidman plays the role of a 58-year-old woman, and Harris Dickinson is only 28. In modern cinema, such a couple seems rare, because more often than not, it is the man who turns out to be older. Kidman did a great job with the role, as did Dickinson, who had a chance to shine in ""Triangle of Sadness"". The love scenes are truly impressive, but I would like more variety and more candid moments. The music and many dance scenes give the film a special piquancy, creating an atmosphere of intriguing attraction. Overall, I liked the film, I give it a solid seven. I also recommend Roman Polanski\'s 1992 film ""Bitter Moon"", which also immerses you in the world of passion and complex relationships.', 'Can anyone doubt that Nicole Kidman is one of the world\'s great actresses? I certainly don\'t. What other actress of her generation could so convincingly play a high-powered married mom/tech CEO who overcomes lifelong sexual self-repression via a cunning, soft-spoken male intern half her age who at once she cannot respect and yet cannot resist? There\'s Julianne Moore, for sure. Likewise Hilary Swank and Charlize Theron. Possibly Rachel McAdams and Emily Blunt. But Miss Kidman delivers here in a way that perhaps even these actresses might not be able to equal. Guided by the sensitive direction of Dutch native Halina Reijn, Kidman puts on full display the many contradictions of feminism, not to mention the impossibility of separating sexual desire and power. And if she\'s playing her real self to an extent, well..so what?\n\n""Babygirl"" has its antecedents -- ""Belle du Jour,"" ""Basic Instinct,"" ""Fatal Attraction"" and Kidman\'s own turn in Kubrick\'s ""Eyes Wide Shut."" But this film goes deeper emotionally. Even in subdued scenes, the dramatic tension is unyielding. Our better instincts tell us from the start of the affair that her character is not going to leave her husband and two daughters, and run off with a brash, shallow, archetype Bad Boy, and a highly invasive species at that. The larger point is that women, contrary to what they may say outwardly, don\'t want a Nice Guy for a partner. Is this instinct rational? Fair? No and no. It\'s just life. Yes, even feminists on occasion crave submission, even in ways that render her helpless and even abused. She\'s not getting that feeling from her husband, superbly played by an increasingly preturbed Antonio Banderas. Like it or not, BDSM fulfills a need for many people even as it risks paying with fire.\n\nI won\'t give away the story line, except to say that the movie has an appropriately satisfying ending. Kidman\'s character ultimately doesn\'t deny her animalistic, baby-like side; she simply transfers it to where it matters. Go see ""Babygirl"" if you haven\'t already. And if you haven\'t, crawl.', ""Nicole Kidman delivers a virtuoso performance in Babygirl, anchoring the film with her usual intensity. Her portrayal is both commanding and tender, elevating every scene she's in. Antonio Banderas and Harris Dickinson also shine in well-crafted roles that give them plenty of material to flex their considerable talents.\n\nThe opening sequence sets the tone, drawing the audience in with a blend of sex and errotica. As the story unfolds, the film builds on this foundation, delivering moments of beauty, intrigue, and drama. However, despite its promising trajectory, Babygirl stumbles at the finish line. The ending feels like a narrative cop-out that undermines the emotional investment built throughout the film.\n\nWhile the conclusion may leave some viewers unsatisfied, the journey to get there is still worth taking. Kidman's performance alone is reason enough to watch, and the strong supporting cast ensures there's plenty to admire along the way."", ""I can't get over how much my husband and I did not like this movie. There's nothing to it except too much of Nicole Kidman panting. The plot is boring, scenes are drawn out, and there's no character development. I didn't care what was going to happen and I thought it wasn't believable. There's no way some young intern would behave the way he did and not get fired. He was way too confident and weird. I really would just like my money back and move on. Warning to anyone who's sensitive to jumpy/blurry filming style, there's a lot of it. I had to close my eyes sometimes to avoid getting a headache. Basically this was an entirely forgettable movie."", '""Babygirl"" is one of those eye candy treats to watch as you the viewer will enjoy the raw and blunt, provocative scenes of lust and passion. As many of us can relate to this film as we have lived and dreamed of sexual flings and pushing the limit, and this film certainly does all of that for us. You may feel like it\'s a ""Fatal Attraction"" type but the key wild card of the film is the central character Romy(Nicole Kidman) as Kidman once again shines in a far out and complicated role just as she has in ""Cold Mountain"", ""To Die For"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Kidman is Romy a highly successful CEO who\'s married(husband Jacob played by Antonio Banderas) and has children. You think she has it all still something is missing as in her intimate love life she just can\'t get no satisfaction, Romy even tries online porn to help her cravings. Only enter Samuel(Harris Dickerson) a young up and coming stubborn intern who has an eye for fun yet he wants to be in control, and after meeting Romy she gives in as it\'s just what the doctor ordered. Sexual fantasy and fetishes are taken to the max in this film as many of the scenes are kinky with hot and steamy nude scenes. However guilt, and power struggle sets in as Romy feels it\'s wrong to cheat in the workplace as this is a threat to her family and career. This film call it an erotic thriller drama type, still it\'s a fun guilty like pleasure to watch as many of us enjoy and can relate to as it makes aware what it\'s like to find one\'s self and what they like when it comes to intimate and erotic feelings.', 'Nicole Kidman is giving a performance in ""Babygirl"" that no doubt many people will be calling ""brave,"" mostly because it suggests that women over the age of 50 (gasp!) like to have sex and maybe even like to get kinky once in a while.\n\nShe does give a good performance, and it\'s the movie\'s biggest selling point. It\'s a shame that by the time the film is over her performance has been diluted by a muddled screenplay that doesn\'t know what it wants to say about gender dynamics or the sexual power play between men and women. Maybe confusion is the point, because Kidman\'s character doesn\'t completely know what she wants. She enjoys her place as a powerful female leader in the professional world, but she also enjoys relinquishing that power in the bedroom and giving into submissive fantasies. But only up to a point -- submissiveness for women can quickly veer into uncomfortable territory if taken too far by the man they\'re with. Scary can be fun, but after a certain line is crossed, scary is just scary.\n\nI applaud a film that\'s honest about female sexuality, but I wish the topic had been given a better movie than this.\n\nGrade: B.', ""Rating - 7.0: Overall, a pretty good movie that is carried by its aesthetic and Nicole Kidman's performance, but it is held back by its lackluster writing.\n\nDirection - Pretty Good: The direction on a macroscale is pretty good as they created an aesthetic that really suited the movie; The direction on a microscale is pretty good as they used tension and cringe to really heighten the scandal and power dynamic between the two; The storytelling is pretty simple; They use tension very well as the movie uses this to make the moments between the two leads uncomfortable; The movie is very much told from the female perspective and the director does a good job showing this\n\nStory - Decent: The concept is interesting, but the story itself is pretty bland and predictable; The plot structure is very simple; Character writing is good, as you get a sense of how Romy's personal struggles and power dynamic are influencing her decisions, and Samuel's mystery helps make this an intriguing relationship for Romy\n\nScreenplay - Decent to Pretty Good: The dialogue is sound but feels a little too Gen Z; the humor is decent; the symbolism is profound as the movie tackles issues with power dynamics, women in power, and sexual fantasies; the foreshadowing is not good as events toward the end just happen because that is what you expect\n\nActing - Pretty Good: Nicole Kidman - Good to Very Good (A very vulnerable performance as she shows why she is one of the best in Hollywood; She shows a wide range of emotions; She has pretty good chemistry with Dickinson), Harris Dickinson - Pretty Good to Good (He does the best with what is written for the character as his charisma suits the role; He has pretty good chemistry with Nicole Kidman), Sophie Wilde - Decent to Pretty Good (Plays the assistant character well and has decent chemistry with Kidman), Antonio Banderas - Pretty Good (An experienced actor who gets his moments to show his work but is not really given that much screen time), Rest of the cast - Decent to Pretty Good (More about the main cast, but the remaining cast does well in supporting roles)\n\nScore - Pretty Good: Helps establish the tone and aesthetic of the movie;\n\nCinematography - Good: Really enjoyed the cinematography as it gave it an aesthetic that really fit the hustling nature of the New York business world; Really enjoyed how they used the glass reflection as somewhat of a mirror\n\nEditing - Good: The movie felt well-edited, especially toward the end\n\nPacing - Pacing is a little all over the place because it seems slow in many moments, yet they just speed through plot points in other moments; The passage of time is not really clear, so you have no idea what the time period is\n\nClimax - Climax is all right but not really the best in execution;\n\nTone - Tone is very much an erotic thriller;\n\nFinal Notes - I liked the aesthetic of the movie more than the actual story;"", ""This is a very intriguing thriller, indeed.

Sexually dissatisfied by her husband (Antonio Banderas), she finds herself in a complicated sexual relationship with a younger male intern (Harris Dickinson).\n\nThe fourth film by writer-director Halina Reijn, ""Babygirl"" has several ingredients that make it a fairly compelling watch: Firstly, the performances. Kidman rarely misses for me, and this is no exception. She strikes a quiet sort of suffering here as a sexually-frustrated middle-aged woman working in a highly corporate tech-focused world. There is a quiet torture she evokes that is palpable, and her character\'s cerebral nature is wonderfully offset by her husband\'s (played nicely by Banderas), a highly artistic-minded theater director who in many ways is Romy\'s polar opposite. Harris Dickinson is also very good here as Samuel, a wry young intern who attracts Romy through a series of playful encounters and manipulations.\n\nThe film is beautifully shot, with stunning cityscapes and interiors that are modestly but effectively dressed with Christmas lights and other holiday decor (parallels to ""Eyes Wide Shut"" were probably intended, and understandably noted by audiences). The lighting in particular is beautiful, and the film is underpinned by an ominous musical score that is effectively used.\n\nAll that being said, as I was watching ""Babygirl"", I kept thinking to myself: ""I\'ve seen something like this before."" It didn\'t dawn on me until about midway through that the film felt very much like a less dire (and frankly much less intense) take on Michael Haneke\'s ""The Piano Teacher\', a film with a similar setup but different character profiles and much grimmer circumstances. Like that film, ""Babygirl"" is very much a meditation on sexual desire and frustration, although it never reaches a point at which the stakes feel particularly dangerous to us. In that sense, I think the film falters a bit.\n\nThings do resolve here in a manner that ultimately works and serves the arc of the story well enough, but I do think it would have been a much more effective film had the stakes felt less controlled and the characters more vulnerable. Despite that, though, ""Babygirl"" remains worthwhile for its accomplished lead performances and dazzling cinematography. 7/10.', 'Most men that want to see this movie will only be interested in about 5 minutes of onscreen sex and nudity. Let\'s not lie to ourselves. Although there is a feature length movie with a plot, a storyline and a moral, millions of Nicole Kidman fans don\'t care. They care about seeing Nicole Kidman. But buyer beware, this is not the same Kidman what we have been seeing since the late 1980s. She is older now, in her 50\'s, and yet she is still drop dead gorgeous, she is not just entertaining her audience like before. Granted, she will entertain and not let down the millions of ""men"" that want to see her cinematic beauty. Then again, she did not star in this movie to entertain any man. In fact, this is a movie for anyone woman over the age of 40. For those who have criticized or reviewed this movie that is male or was born after George Bush Sr. Left office, you have no business judging this movie.\n\nThis is a ladies only, boys not allowed club house. The point of this movie was to showcase a woman who is no longer in her prime, no longer young or attractive to most men. Although she is still breathtaking, it is obvious she is no longer a teenager. Still, Nicole gives a truthful performance as a woman who wants to feel like she once did. The sex scenes scream a vulnerability that Kidman has displayed before. This is not soft core or anything exploitative because the subject matter at hand is pure.\n\nA good movie that will attract two opposite audiences with different reasons why they are buying a ticket. In the end, both these types of viewers will get what they paid for. A connection of vulnerability and worth in the eyes of every woman has every felt the pain of time and the irresistible eye candy of Nicole Kidman which will never get old.', ""This movie is bad all around. The acting was blah. The plot & story were almost nonexistent. They threw some random character descriptions in but those things were vague and never revealed much purpose in the story (ex. Gay daughter, Nicole's upbringing in a cult and commune). There were times I laughed out loud because the movie was so poorly directed. It truly was laughable. It could have developed into much more but it failed.\n\nIt's so disappointing to take the time to see movies in the theater when there's nothing worthy. No effort, no story, lame! I'm tired of wasting money on horrible movies. Add this to the list!"", 'This is my first review ever. This film moved me beyond words. It has many layers, it is deeply human.\n\nThe film shows that women have desires and that we have nothing to be ashamed of. We women want to be ""normal"", that we suppress what we want because of that. Romy had lived her life like this until a young man senses her desires that he shares. Shame and fear kept Romy from telling her husband.\n\nThe sex scenes are tasteful, not rude at all. No unneccessary nudity. And there is playfullness and tenderness at times.\n\nAll actors are great. I can sense that Halina Reijn inspired them for heartfelt performances. I would love to play a role like Romy!', 'I was excited about seeing this movie because of the trailer. Alas, the only interesting things in this movie are included in the trailer; the rest of it is a lot of cliches strung together with soft-core pornography. The ""story"" concerns an oversexed female executive in a large corporation who becomes involved with a young male intern. They get into kinky sex games of dominance and discipline. (One example is when he commands her to get down on all fours and drink milk from a saucer.) This is not erotic; it\'s just stupid. I did not buy this relationship at all. I didn\'t believe a powerful woman like this would be foolish enough to fall for a ""twink."" She has a husband (Antonio Banderas, understandably looking embarrassed) and two teenage daughters, of whom one is openly lesbian. It\'s all improbable and unbelievable. Writer/director Halina Reijn shows no sign of competence in either capacity. I felt sorry for the actors. They had no characters to act, just a lot of symbols and ""types."" Kidman tries to make her role believable, but not even she can pull this one off. Another movie like this one could kill her career.', ""If you have experience with power play in sex things look fairly banal and unrealistic. There was some legitimate build up of the characters and the dynamics between them but soon you feel tired, bored of the plot's lack of depth. The non D/S relationships between the characters could have been further explored as well as a more elaborated ended could be useful. You feel as if there is knowledge about the topic but lack of good ideas on how to bring it forward or make it go to elevate it to level 3 or 4. Besides that it will make a pleasant Netflix evening, Kidman was good, and porn searches on ddlg will go up!"", ""Forget It Ends with us!!! 2024 Ends with BABYGIRL! THIS MOVIE IS A GEM! Harris Dickinson and Nicole work so well together. The vulnerable scenes blew me away. Felt soooo real. I loved the intimate chemistry and filming too. I've been a fan of both of them and to see then together in this movie was such a Christmas Gift! Absolutely nothing wrong with this movie in my eyes. It had me wanting more of their story! Please gives a part two for her!!! So much more that could be built off this story. Highly recommend- Pure talented artists!\n\nAlso shout out to these actors for showing the world of cinema how to pull off intimate scenes with grace and class and still make it artistic and believable!!! I don't blame Nicole for enjoying every minute of it:) :)"", ""Being Dutch, like the director Halina, I was very sceptical. A lot of movies coming from Dutch directors revolve around sex and often portrayed in a very explicit manner that doesn't always help the story.\n\nBabygirl is different. It is provocative and explicit, in a good way because it actually serves the storyline. There is a suspense to it, platfullness and eroticism that is quite unique for contemporary movies. It dares to be uncomfortable and challenge your beliefs on relationships, sex, power dynamics.\n\nI read a lot of people having a hard time with the fact that both characters don't have to face a lot of consequences from their 'bad' behaviour. I see this differently. At the end of the day they are both grownups and the movie is not about exploring the me-too theme at all, it is not ment to be moralistic and judge these characters. It's about exploring female desire.\n\nAnd I have to say both lead actors give stellar performances. That also helps!\n\nGood job Halina!"", 'This movie was so bad. I have never been blue-balled harder in my life. They advertised this film as a kinky, age gap, romantic thriller. None of that is true.\n\nEvery time I thought Sam and Romy were about to have a steamy scene... cut to nothing. There was so much potential with the story and the setup and I\'m very disappointed with the execution. The ""After"" movie series had better erotic scenes than this. Also, the slander of older women in this film was bad, they kept pointing out how old Romy was as if a major point wasn\'t the fact that she was older than Sam.\n\nThe music choice was also interesting because they kept using the same song to add suspense that built to nothing, they did not explore the kinky side of their relationship as much as they should have. Another thing, Romy\'s back story of growing up in a cult and coming out as a boss woman CEO is not made a big deal like it should be.\n\nThis movie is not empowering to women\'s sexuality at all.

She asked to leave multiple times but I kept saying ""maybe it\'ll get better"". It did not get better. They needed to explain more. The characters were weird...........it was miscast horribly except for Kidman and that\'s only because weird films tend to be her go to. This is the worst movie I\'ve ever seen in my life and certain scenes keep running through my mind with the thought of ""what the f... did I watch???"" I feel like I took a gamble on a movie that had no trailer and no poster and really was let down. This movie could have been so much more.', ""Nicole Kidman deserves all the praise in her career she is sensationally talented! I absolutely loved the soundtrack more than anything else, the directing was exceptional and amazing acting glad this is nominated! I saw around dinner time January 2nd and quite enjoyed more than expected especially for going in without knowing anything. Probably my only complaint it's quite a sexual story which might be a little uneasy on some audiences otherwise top notch all around.\n\nNot sure if it's worth mentioning I thought it was odd how 3 girls to the left of me went closer halfway in I felt bad if I did anything wrong whatever though hope anyone enjoys Babygirl no matter what. Also sorry for mentioning anything off topic or anything else if it makes a difference I have autism not much accept me regardless I loved everything especially the soundtrack. Of course my thoughts are being bashed I don't know why some things occur it was strange doesn't mean anything bad though."", 'Kudos for Nicole Kidman for taking on an edgy role like this. She looks great and this was perfectly cast for this role. The only other actress that could have pulled this off would have been Demi Moore. On that note, this movie would make a great double bill with ""The Substance"". I was glued to my chair and completely captivated in the theatre for the entire movie. The eighties music was perfectly curated as well. Antonio Banderas also turns in a fantastic performance. I wish there could have been some cameo appearances by Mickey Rourke and Kim Bassinger. This movie is not for the kidos, btw. I am going back to my local theatre to see it for a second time soon!', ""So many things made me feel uncomfortable about a movie with so few redeeming features; Cheating on one's partner mainly, but also I couldn't help wondering if. Romy's orgasms were as fake as her bad wig. There's quite a lot off about this movie, including a lot of tired ideas the director brought to this project, including reviving the 90s erotic drama genre, starring an actress approaching 60 but desperately trying to look and appear younger. That itself would have made an interesting premise for a film about female vanity and insecurity and the neurotic need to cling to youth, including an affair with a young lover. Despite the huge marketing campaign & manufactured hype, this is not a good movie... lack of subtlety, clumsy ideas about power dynamics, bad acting and bad wigs."", 'I THOUGHT IT WAS A DARING MOVE ON NICOLE KIDMANS PART to take this role. ANTONIO BANDARES was not wasted. HARRIS DICKINSON played his character cool and rational...quite a feat ..very believable I thought it VERY EROTIC and SEDUCTIVE .The way it was directed and shot fit the storyline to perfection. Its a very sexy movie. It slowly unfolded the only thought I have to mention is that the ending was NOTHING like I had expected and it got wrapped up alittle too easily. Again Nicole Kiidman gave herself a complex character that she developed fully and she looked stunning.

There is no thriller here, just a drama about someone cheating, and cheating and cheating, only because of fantasies that run counter to their mainstream life.\n\nThe director, be she gay or not, is, among other things, a therapist, which is probably why the acting is first rate but there is also a lot of talk and role playing. The only nudity is from Kidman that seems rather strange and the whole thing has a sell out twist that makes it all very safe. By that I mean that Kidman\'s character runs a corporation yet is sexually unfufilled despite what seems a happy marriage and kids--one of whom is either gay or trans--possibly. So the story concept seems to be teasing the idea of does this powerful woman secretly want to be helpless in order to be sexually happy? An edgy topic for sure.\n\nThe bulk of the movie, too much, are the sex scenes though mostly it\'s about her being told to do things, like drink milk from a cat bowl. The movie wallows in this stuff, perhaps fan of submission will enjoy it on that level, why not? But the story, especially the ending, doesn\'t come off in any kind of supportive or sympathetic way. As can be the case this movie settles for a women good, men bad ending, leaving behind some interesting and challenging elements along the way. And it\'s a long way, there is little plot and the ending when it finally comes is rather rushed.\n\nKidman is well cast and all the actors make the material more interesting, if ultimately not compelling, for longer than would be possible. Banderas as her husbands role should realy be larger.\n\nAnother thing is a fair amount of wealth porn, both Kidman and Bandaras are super rich. This fights against some connection the audience could have for them, but instead you\'ll find yourself saying, ""Wow, nice Pool. Wow, nice office. Wow, he\'s a broadway play director. Wow nice wardrobe!\n\nInteresting use of music and songs which is very loud and starts and stops abruptly. A lot of shallow focus, the opening shot is effective and unusual, but this lack of focus is distracting as it goes on, having things pull in and out of focus, there are moments where one eye is in focus and not the other, it\'s just not very well shot and feels a bit like video. Kidman sometimes looks great and sometimes aging, which if controlled could fit into the story very neatly, but it seems more an accident of how it was lit and shot, not intent.\n\nSo again, this is NOT A THRILLER. It\'s slightly highminded arthouse sexploitation film, if that\'s what you\'re looking for you\'ll find this most satisfying.', ""This is an embarrassing laughable movie of thriller cliches and Nicole Kidman melodrama. Nicole comes off stiff, frozen and awkward like most movies she has made in the last decade. Everyone else is fine but characters in every crime drama on tv. No one stands out. We've all seen this before and more importantly, we've seen much better. I honestly don't understand why she puts herself in these flicks. She's beyond it. She needs to take roles that suit her talent and age. I haven't seen that in many years.\n\nIf you want this type of entertainment- please watch the Hallmark channel. It's the same thing."", ""Talk about misleading, the trailers caught my attention. But likely lead me to believe more than the movie was intended to be, what a complete let down. What I hoped for was something like a cross between 50 Shades and Magic Mike; strong, confident, sensuality, chemistry and sexual desire but instead left feeling cringy and ick!\n\nFrom the beginning of the movie til the very last moment it was disappointing. Zero sensuality, no emotional connection, neither actor lured you in with their performance! Romy (NK) didn't portray a high powered confident CEO, but rather one who was mentally weak and deranged. And the young intern Samuel was nothing to be desired, together they lacked depth."", 'Nicole Kidman has built a storied career of nuanced performances and fearless choices, but her latest film, Babygirl, is not just a misstep-it\'s an outright disgrace. As a woman of Kidman\'s own age, I\'ve long admired her ability to navigate Hollywood\'s often misogynistic demands with grace and intelligence. However, Babygirl plunges headfirst into the cesspool of our cultural decay, trading any semblance of meaningful storytelling for cheap shock value and the crass exploitation of taboos.\n\nThis film is an assault on good taste and decency, a shameless example of the ""pornification"" of modern media. The plot ostensibly follows Kidman\'s character, a middle-aged woman caught in a chaotic downward spiral involving a much younger man. What could have been a poignant exploration of age, desire, and power instead devolves into a grotesque spectacle that revels in shock tactics and depravity. Every scene reeks of desperation to provoke, reducing the characters to pitiful caricatures and stripping the story of any emotional depth.\n\nBut the content is only part of the problem. What makes Babygirl even more reprehensible is the way it is packaged and marketed. It drips with a juvenile obsession with provocation and salaciousness, reveling in its vulgarity. This isn\'t art pushing boundaries with purpose or insight; it\'s exploitative trash, a film designed to cheapen the conversation rather than elevate it. The film uses taboo relationships, gratuitous imagery, and sensational themes as a crutch, substituting titillation for the nuance and complexity this story could have delivered.\n\nWorse still is the repugnant message the movie sends about women and aging. Nicole Kidman, an actress whose career has been built on intelligence and class, is here reduced to a prop in a tawdry spectacle. At her age-and mine-we deserve stories that reflect our complexities and lived experiences, not ones that demean us or portray us as pathetic and desperate in the name of shock value. Watching Babygirl is an exercise in humiliation for its female audience, and Kidman deserves better.\n\nThe film\'s fixation on the older woman and younger man dynamic is ripe for thoughtful exploration, but here it\'s twisted into a grotesque parody. Instead of offering any meaningful insight, the story becomes a vehicle for voyeurism. It\'s an offensive, outdated stereotype that paints older women as unhinged predators while glorifying the male gaze. The younger male character is a hollow shell, a lifeless pawn in the film\'s quest for provocation. Watching this dynamic play out is nauseating, a grim reminder of how far we have yet to go in portraying genuine human relationships onscreen.\n\nLet me be clear: no young man, woman, or girl should see this film. Babygirl perpetuates the most toxic aspects of our culture, teaching that shock value is more important than substance, that relationships are devoid of meaning, and that human connection is just a lurid spectacle. For a society already drowning in hypersexualized garbage, Babygirl is gasoline on the fire.\n\nHaving spent decades consuming art that takes risks and challenges societal norms, I know the difference between art that shocks with purpose and trash that shocks for its own sake. Babygirl is firmly in the latter camp. True art unsettles us because it reveals something profound; this film wallows in the gutter, dragging its talented cast and audience down with it. There\'s no insight here, only cynicism and exploitation.\n\nNicole Kidman\'s performance is the film\'s only saving grace, but even she cannot save this disaster. Her talents are wasted on a character so poorly written and devoid of purpose that watching her try to inject life into this role feels painful. The blame lies squarely with a script and direction that prioritize sleaze over storytelling. Watching Kidman in this debacle felt like witnessing a master reduced to performing in a low-budget circus act.\n\nI left the theater not just disappointed but disgusted. This isn\'t a film that challenges or enlightens; it degrades and diminishes its subjects and its viewers. In a world already too eager to objectify and degrade, Babygirl drags us further into the mire.\n\nIf this is the direction cinema is headed, we are in serious trouble. A film like Babygirl should serve as a wake-up call-not for its content but for its very existence. We must demand better from our storytellers, our culture, and ourselves.', ""Suspension of disbelief-I'm always willing to open my mind to the world of any given story. But the plot needs to meet me halfway.\n\nIt may sound exaggerated, but this is my honest impression: this movie doesn't have a single scene that's remotely believable. Not a single one. From the very first minute (literally the first minute of the film) to the final scene, passing through every moment in between. And it's important to point out that it's not about doubting the existence of people with very unusual fantasies; rather, the situations in this movie are completely implausible. I'm not talking about one or two moments, but every scene, the entire film. There are even moments where the movie openly flirts with the ridiculous (there were two or three instances where I heard people in the theater laughing- at the sheer nonsense of the situations and lines).\n\nNicole Kidman is an amazing actress, no doubt about that. The problem isn't with her performance. But I can imagine that she gets more than a dozen offers to work on different projects, and she has the luxury of choosing which ones to take on. And for me, it's really hard to believe this was the best project she had on the table."", 'There\'s something particularly maddening about a movie that demands two hours of your life but gives absolutely nothing in return. ""Baby Girl"" is one such disaster-a bewildering, pointless exercise in bad storytelling, uninspired direction, and empty performances.\n\nThe film struggles from the outset, failing to establish any meaningful plot or purpose. Its attempt at being profound is laughable at best, with scenes meandering aimlessly, leaving viewers questioning why they\'re still watching. Any hint of a narrative is buried under layers of incoherent dialogue, abrupt tonal shifts, and characters so shallow they could evaporate in direct sunlight.\n\nThe protagonist-if you can even call her that-spends most of the film alternating between brooding and making incomprehensible decisions. Her motivations are never clear, and by the time the credits roll, you\'re left wondering if the writers even knew what they were trying to achieve. The supporting cast fares no better, delivering stilted performances that seem more fitting for a community theater audition than a feature film.\n\nVisually, ""Baby Girl"" offers little to redeem itself. The cinematography is uninspired, with a bland color palette and unimaginative framing. Even the soundtrack-typically a saving grace for many films-is forgettable, leaving scenes feeling even more lifeless than they already are.\n\nPerhaps the most damning aspect of ""Baby Girl"" is its utter lack of direction. It\'s as though the filmmakers had a vague idea but no clue how to execute it. The result is a film that\'s not just bad-it\'s utterly pointless. There\'s no emotional payoff, no engaging story, and certainly no reason for anyone to endure it.\n\nIf you\'re looking for a movie to hate-watch, ""Baby Girl"" might fit the bill. But for anyone hoping to be entertained, moved, or even mildly interested, steer clear. Life\'s too short for films like this.']",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/babygirl/41d3fda4-9979-414a-bcc1-e18da82a29ac.webp

Somehow they managed to make this franchise even bigger than the previous.\n\nThis doesn't hold back on the fan service and Sonic fans like myself will definitely be pleased with how the story is handled, but also how they handle the characters, visuals, and even the music.\n\nThe human characters Tom and Maddie, are probably the only element in this movie I could have with or without. They don't really serve a big purpose other than to move the story along. But they're not horrible characters. I like them fine, they just don't have much screen time. But I'm also okay with that because we come to these movies to see Sonic and the gang.\n\nJim Carrey once again proves why he is the perfect casting for Doctor Eggman. And not only that but is pulling double duty in this movie. It's so much fun watching him play both characters and you can feel his energy in this role and how much he loves playing it. This is also his first role he's returned to for a 3rd time in his expansive career. It's nice to see he's still got it after all these years.\n\nKeanu Reeves as the voice of Shadow is another amazing choice for this character. He really emulates Shadows complex character and tragic past. You can really feel the raw emotion from his performance. In all honesty, if Sega wanted to hire these voices to be in their next Sonic game, I wouldn't be disappointed. Not that their video game counterparts are bad, it's just how good the movie actors are in the roles.\n\nThe story in this movie is so well adapted and it really brings the emotion you want from the kind of story they're telling. Sonic in this movie is most like himself from the games than any other movie yet. This is great fun for any Sonic fan and/or for the family to go and see for the weekend.\n\nThe only complaint I really have is I wish the movie was a little longer so that it could really develop Shadow's story a little more and give it even more time to have even more weight to it. At times it felt a little rushed, but it overall was done really well. You still feel the emotional pull on the heart strings that they're trying to make the audience feel, I just wish there was more."", ""You can tell the people who made this movie care. They care about creating something true to the source material. They care about the fans and their enjoyment. They care about just making a good movie.\n\nThis third chapter in the series is a blast. We see continued escalation and expansion while balancing so many characters and story points. It could have easily been a jumbled mess, but it's so smooth.\n\nTwo things that jumped a level from previous entries: the action and the visuals. There are several beastly action scenes that had me grinning ear to ear. And so many shots are visually mesmerizing, even borderline trippy. And sometimes these two things overlap... like I said before, they care.\n\nJim Carrey is the GOAT. This is the third time I've written that in a Sonic review. With his ridiculously deep filmography, I never thought I'd say Dr. Robotnik is one of his best roles ever.\n\nAs long as they keep putting this much care into making these movies, I will watch as many as they want to make. Every other prospective video game adaptation needs to take notes.\n\n(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 12/19/2024)"", ""GenX reporting in. Just got back from the first screening at our AMC with my 12 year old. We both agreed that this was the best sonic film, the closest to the games, with great action scenes, a ton of laughing... Jim Carey nails this once again, but even funnier with two of him on screen! A fantastic soundtrack including one of my all time favorite bands, The Travelling Wilburys! Fantastic visual effects that are very 3D in the 2D format. The perfect run time, isn't too short, and just as soon as you get tired it wraps up. Stay past the beginning credits for a scene that hints at part 4, which satisfied all the kids around us. We walked out smiling, this one had it all! Well done and recommended."", 'Let\'s be honest: You\'re seeing ""Sonic the Hedgehog 3"" because you\'re either a fan of the gaming franchise or the two films that came before it. I\'m a fan of the latter, although they are not perfect. I knew, didn\'t think, but knew that this third installment would beat them both, and I was right.\n\nBeginning with Keanu Reeves, breathtaking is putting it mildly. His performance and the overall character of Shadow the Hedgehog, coming from a guy who has never played the games, was jaw-dropping. Dr. Robotnik and Knuckles are great villains in the prior two installments. Shadow surpasses them by having an origin story that, while familiar to veteran players of the games, is more tragic than any of the other characters in the franchise, Sonic included. I\'m a huge fan of Reeves; what more is there to say?\n\nEven though Shadow steals the show, the returning characters are still strong. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are just as funny and charming as their appearances in the previous two entries, helped by Ben Schwartz, Colleen O\'Shaughnessey, and Idris Elba\'s energetic performances. What surprised me the most was how they put all three in a shocking internal conflict, one which I refuse to spoil in any fashion. You need to see it for yourself!\n\nI can\'t forget Jim Carrey as the two Robotniks. First of all, he came out of potential retirement for this. This review is written by a tremendous Carrey admirer, making it a big deal to me when they announced that he would reprise his role as Dr. Robotnik in this trilogy-capper. Of course, he recently said he returned because he needed the money, which is understandable, but this was no cash-grab role for Carrey. He brings some next-level comedic energy when playing both Ivo and Gerald Robotnik. Every time he\'s in a movie, he always makes me, and millions more, smile and laugh, and here is no different. Power-rest with pride and dignity, Carrey. Your work will continue to inspire generations to come.\n\nI want to take a break to discuss the experience instead of the movie\'s contents. I saw it at a Dolby Fan Event, my second time with the format since ""Wicked."" Dolby enhanced both films for me, so be sure to see it that way. The theater I was in did something unexpected: skipped coming attractions. AMC usually allows audiences twenty minutes to go to the restroom or get popcorn by playing trailers for future releases, but not here. I feel bad for the people who came in late under the impression that it wouldn\'t start right when they arrived. Additionally, I reserve that time to go to the restroom quickly. However, the film began immediately, and I only focused on the movie rather than anything else, a testament to how excited I was and how extraordinary the following presentation was.\n\nI\'ll resume talking about the movie itself now. The action was some of the best I\'ve seen all year. The other Sonic films, admittedly, had incredible action, but this cranked the volume up to 11! If we\'re only covering action, you bet it\'s super fun!\n\nWhat else makes the movie remarkably powerful is it\'s hilarious, the story outside of Shadow is compelling, the CGI remains beautiful, and the people in my theater were freaking out at the mid and post-credit scenes. Make sure to stay for that, Sonic fan or not!\n\nIf I were to give any semi-negatives, the comedy simultaneously surpasses and is consistent with the other two films. It\'s consistent in how it\'s sometimes juvenile to its detriment. I also found Krysten Ritter\'s Director Rockwell to be weak, but here\'s what\'s truly remarkable: I don\'t care. In a year in which I\'ve perhaps become more of a critic than a film fan despite my personal beliefs that I haven\'t, I deserve and need to overlook the flaws because the rest of the film is unbelievably phenomenal!\n\n""Sonic the Hedgehog 3"" blew my mind, and I didn\'t expect it to. I went in with high expectations, yet still accepted the possibility that it can\'t be as wonderful as the hype warrants. I was wrong.\n\nTechnically, the voice acting and performances from the humans (awkward way of saying it, apologies), the CGI, the well-used runtime, and the impactful narrative make the technical score a 9/10. Said 9 is because of some issues relating to the screenplay.\n\nFor the enjoyment score, I loved it! It\'s easily the best of the trilogy and one of the year\'s best films. I\'m writing this before I watch the second film in the hopeful next Barbenheimer post-Glicked: ""Sonic the Hedgehog 3"" and ""Mufasa: The Lion King."" Mufasa has no chance! My problems with some dialogue and Rockwell can\'t prevent the enjoyment score from being a 10/10. The flaws are not enough to hurt the experience, and I\'m happy I can ignore them. This experience is a must-watch for any Sonic fan and enjoyer of the preceding two films, and I\'m thrilled to see what this franchise offers next!', ""I wanted to love it but couldn't quite get there. I feel like the movie was trying too hard to be funny. The scenes where we have genuine emotion and intensity is when the movie shines most. However they were sparse.\n\n90% of Team Sonic's lines were corny jokes which took away the gravity of the situations they were facing. The fans want epic scenes that showcase the awesome ability of the hedgehog's and foes yet there wasn't enough or they were too brief.\n\nThere were some awesome moments in the movie but i wanted them to go for a bit longer (sonic v shadow in the finale). I also liked the relationship between the Robotniks', comedy and genuine emotion. A nice combo. Jim Carey provided a great performance too (acting and dancing).\n\nYou can see the people surrounding the film truly cared about the end product which all sonic fans can appreciate.\n\nHowever the over used jokes and lack of time spent on the better moments prevent the film from being truly spectacular. However, still an enjoyable popcorn flick.\n\nGotta go fast!!!!"", ""Sonic The Hedgehog 3 is easily the best of the trilogy.\n\nBest writing, best characterisation, great humour and Keanu Reeves was absolute CLASS as Shadow.\n\nThis movie differs from the first 2, most evidently being in the tone of the movie, this movie is a soul adaptation of Sonic Adventure 2 and they handled it better than I would've ever thought.\n\nShadow's past is portrayed hauntingly beautiful, not to mention his immaculate CGI model, I was so impressed by how he looked.\n\nJim Carrey was humorous as usual, an absolute treat to have in our franchise, he was hilariously amazing as both Ivo & Gerald.\n\nBen Schwartz, Colleen & Idris all shined more than ever.\n\nAs a huge Sonic fan, this movie passed my expectations, what a feeling to be a Sonic fan!\n\nThis movie goes down as a rich part of Sonics history.\n\n9/10."", 'The best trillogy in the franchise the fitgh scene and CGI is incerdible and emotial sonic fans is going love this flim event the way they go about bringin back like rachel a controversial original character for this movie. The way she is brought into the movie and the small role. She plays tought fit well for people who whant see that character while also connecting tings that have happened in previous movie but the one human character you do want to see a lot of that is working double time Jim carrey as both Robotnik Gerald robotik.the biggest Jim carrey simp he is the guy and nowaday we juts do not gave anough Carrey zaninees on the big screen. And my rating is 7.4 /10.', ""This was a pleasant surprise. As a father who has spent days of my life sitting through the first two entries, I'm so relieved that the series shifted into a new gear.\n\nThe character development hit harder, the action was more exciting, and the humor hit new highs. The villains were three-dimensional and it was a joy spending the movie with the trio of Knuckles, Tails and Sonic operating with fully-formed friendship. It wasn't without nits to pick - I personally found the editing to be noticeably choppy at times - but the pros well outweigh the cons.\n\nI can't stress enough that people familiar with the series will get a new and welcome take on how the series operates. Same chassis, new engine."", ""Easily the best one, which coincidentally contains the majority of actual Sonic moments in this entire trilogy. Keanu Reeves absolutely steals the show as Shadow, he portrays the ruthlessness and immense emotional pain of his character incredibly well. Also Jim Carrey pulls off acting as the dual Dr Robotniks with incredible comedic timing, especially with each himself, as it really feels like these are two separate characters.\n\nThe human subplots are as mediocre as usual but are infinitely more tolerable here as they tie into the main story much more naturally. Also, while they do adapt the Sonic Adventure 2 storyline as best as they could in the universe they've established, I feel like they could have gone deeper in exploring the bond between Shadow and Maria."", ""I saw Sonic The Hedgehog 1 & 2 a few years ago and they were okay, but they didn't grab me or fit my entertainment level, but SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3 IS PERFECT...I wasn't going to see this in theaters until I realized SHADOW WAS IN IT.... Shadow has that Darth Vader, Joker, and Thanos type of aura...he is an awesome character with a dark side...Shadow was in it, but was the movie any good? YES THE MOVIE IS SICK...Dr Robotnik's antics and comedy hit very well, there aren't a bunch of children jokes or childish themes, there are many adult jokes and it's serious enough for Shadow to be in it. This one is for the grown 90s and 80s kids that played the games...They used Shadow perfectly, unstoppable, scary, and menacing...Also the references to Sonic Adventure 2 Battle are great...some scenes were corny but overall the movie beat my expectations because the last two Sonic films did not impress me...THIS ONE DID IT."", ""My history of Sonic the Hedgehog is interesting as I'm not the BIGGEST fan of Sonic, I enjoyed playing the games growing up, especially on the DS. Media wise, it's been a hit or miss as some have been fun and some have been pretty bad (Sonic X English Dub for sure). With the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog films we have been offered, it has been surprisingly solid for the most part as it understands what the fans want and what made the character of Sonic interesting. Thus, this sequel might be the best one so far.\n\nFilled with solid production, effects, and the action sequences being well-done, the direction and atmosphere understands the emotional and non-serious sequences together very well. The characters of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Shadow have interesting personalities and are provided with wonderful voice performances from the cast, particular Keanu Reeves who surprisingly, as a voice performance, is pretty great! I would love to see Reeves do more voice performances in animation in the future. Regarding the human characters, from the past movies, I wasn't too big with the human characters since I didn't really care for them too much, in this movie, I have some of the same feelings as before. Jim Carrey once again does an amazing job on his performance as Dr. Eggman.\n\nOf course, it does have faults as some of the decisions made, I personally, thought could have been done a bit different. Some dialogue choices are a bit rough and some humor is a bit tad repetitive. Including some moments of product placement from the background or scenes that were a bit off-putting.\n\nBut nevertheless, I'm happy we are able to get something out of it."", ""Hold onto your chili dogs, folks! Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is a blue streak of pure, unadulterated fun. Director Jeff Fowler delivers another visually spectacular and laugh-out-loud hilarious adventure that's sure to delight fans of all ages.\n\nBen Schwartz once again nails the voice of Sonic, capturing the character's trademark energy and wit. Jim Carrey continues to steal the show as the eccentric Dr. Robotnik, delivering some truly outrageous moments of comedic gold. Idris Elba's Knuckles, still delightfully literal, gets some hilarious one-liners, while Colleen O'Shaughnessey's Tails remains the tech-savvy glue of the team, and Keanu Reeves brings a brooding intensity to the role, making Shadow a truly formidable and captivating villain.\n\nThe action sequences are jaw-dropping, with Sonic and his friends zipping around the globe at breakneck speeds. The humor, a blend of classic slapstick and witty dialogue, will have audiences of all ages laughing out loud. But beneath the surface of the high-octane thrills, Sonic 3 explores themes of friendship, trust, and the importance of accepting others for who they are.\n\nWhether you're a longtime Sonic fan or simply looking for a fun and entertaining movie experience, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 delivers the goods. It's a fast-paced, funny, and visually stunning adventure."", 'This is a very good movie a must watch for every fan. I recommend this to everyone who wants to have fun. The scenes are cool the story is mostly the same with a little bit of changes. Sonic Adventure 2 adaptation is exelent. Live and Learn remix is awsome. Best movie in this year an probably the next year too. CGI was upped and it was very good, I am looking forward to the next part and what it has to be better than this part if it is even possible. Post credits were fun and they were teasing things that are going to come in this franchise and I am all up for it it is a very good movie overall.', '\'Sonic The Hedgehog 3 (2024)\' continues its series\' trend of giving fans more and more of exactly what they want, which is strange considering the first film originally featured what\'s since semi-affectionately been referred to as Ugly Sonic. Actually, it\'s not all that weird, because this is a series that proved it genuinely listens to its audience right out of the gate by taking the time to address their most pressing concern. It\'s not as if reconfiguring Sonic into a more pleasant shape was only beneficial to the audience - after all, it\'s one of the most important factors in the franchise\'s continuing success (both financial and otherwise) - but it\'s a key sign that the filmmakers respect their viewers enough to realise that their opinions do, to a reasonable extent, matter and that they deserve to be treated with respect. That\'s likely how this series has managed to avoid the video-game adaptation curse, essentially improving with each entry and showing no real signs of slowing down.\n\nThankfully, neither is its greatest on-screen element, whose return from retirement was said to only be a possibility if the angels delivered him a script inked in gold that would be important for people to see. Well, I don\'t know about any angels, but Jeff Fowler reportedly did deliver a screenplay inked in 24-carat to Jim Carrey\'s doorstep, and said script was important enough for the star to sign on. To be fair, perhaps it wasn\'t so much ""important"" as ""irresistibly fun"", as it afforded him the opportunity (and I suppose this is a minor spoiler if you\'ve never seen any of the trailers) to play two distinct characters and bounce off himself while caked in various degrees of transformative make-up. Jim Carrey is, undisputedly, the best thing about this feature. His slapstick shenanigans and scene-chewing dialogue scenes are, almost exclusively, absolute joys to behold, and his antics are almost solely responsible for the film\'s funniest moments. One line is so out of pocket that it had me chuckling to myself seemingly for minutes. While the affair isn\'t constantly as humorous as that, it is surprisingly amusing surprisingly often. It\'s a good amount of silly fun, even though the narrative is actually fairly dark in places.\n\nThat\'s because the film introduces the games\' iconic edge-lord anti-hero, Shadow the Hedgehog. From what I know, the movie presents a fairly faithful adaptation of his backstory, which features death and betrayal and a desire for vengeance. Shadow, here voiced by Keanu Reeves, is a relatively compelling character, one who\'s initially enigmatic but is soon revealed to be more than meets the eye by his internal conflict. He\'s a nice counterpoint to the other, more overtly evil villain (who is far nastier than he is in the games), and he\'s also a good opponent for the jovial and colourful heroes primarily because he\'s almost their exact opposite. It\'s fair to say there are enough cool moments featuring the character to satisfy his fans. Actually, I think it\'s fair to say the villains totally steal the show here.\n\nThat\'s not to imply the heroes aren\'t entertaining in their own right, just that their arcs are less interesting and their characterisations more generic. The fast-talking Sonic is as winningly annoying as ever, but his pals don\'t really get all that much to do. Tails and Knuckles kind of just follow the blue guy around, sort of like in the games, but they only have a couple of moments to shine on their own accord. Plus, just like in the second movie, James Marsden\'s Donut Lord is mostly sidelined, which is a shame considering his camaraderie with Sonic was the highlight - and core - of the first flick. Still, our heroes are likeable and lively, and they partake in a number of exciting set-pieces that often give digital actions practical consequences (via stunt work and pyrotechnics). Furthermore, they make excellent use of the fact that the visual effects are actually quite impressive, capable of balancing cartoony design with convincing integration.\n\nThe story is kind of basic and it features all the beats you\'d expect, but it\'s serviceable enough in getting its characters where they need to be for the finale to make things grander than ever before and, of course, for the film to tickle your ribs and tug at your heartstrings. There\'s an element of emotionality that works rather well; the clumsiness of the messaging is matched by its importance and competent conveyance. However, the best bits of the affair are the absurd ones, be they comedic or cool (there\'s a segment that seems straight out of \'Dragon Ball Z (1996-2003)\' and it\'s as awesome as it is admittedly corny). Nothing here is massively compelling, but it\'s engaging and exciting enough for what it is.\n\nUltimately, this is an enjoyable experience that isn\'t massively unique, affecting or, even, memorable but embraces what it needs to be and delivers something that ought to please fans of its source material. It\'s entertaining, if not especially gripping, and it\'s a lot funnier than you\'d expect it to be (thanks primarily to Jim Carrey, of course). I can\'t put my finger on why, but it doesn\'t really click with me as much as I\'d like it to. It\'s a solid effort, but it falls a little bit short of my expectations. Still, it\'s fun enough for what it is.', ""Sonic 1 was a decent, if generic attempt, at adapting everyone's favourite blue hedgehog. Sonic 2 was step up and proved that this franchise was feasible. With the groundwork laid out, Sonic 3 had the opportunity to give fans what they've dreamed of. Does it succeed? Hell yeah. Mostly.\n\nTo start, the visuals are the strongest they've ever been. The action feels a lot more thought out and creative than the previous films. The characters are all incredibly expressive and thus the emotions get through wonderfully. The soundtrack is a sizeable step up from the previous films, and there are definitely a few surprises for fans.\n\nAs for the plot and characters, they're at an all time high. Ben Schwartz continues to play Sonic well and he is given some more serious stuff to sink his teeth in. Of course the main standouts are Keanu Reeves and Jim Carrey. In Reeves' case, he plays Shadow perfectly. The character is cool, badass yet tragic and the film never tries to overdo it. Jim Carrey continues to shine, this time playing two characters. He is having a blast though the humour may have been overdone slightly.\n\nIssues with this film include the aforementioned overuse of Jim Carrey craziness and other bouts of humour. The human characters once again feel side-lined and ultimately unnecessary. Tom and Maddie are given little to do but they do have their moments. Thankfully, the focus is where it should be, on Sonic and co.\n\nOverall, this film is every Sonic fan's dream. It is easily the strongest of the trilogy and perhaps the best video game movie ever. A must watch for fans and families alike."", 'This movie was heavily inspired by the games Sonic Adventure 2 and Shadow the Hedgehog. Games I never played, so I feel like I missed a lot of the nods to the audience with the story. Despite that, it wasn\'t a bad movie at all, and actually dealt with some heavy themes, but with a lot of ""just for the kids"" moments as well. The fact that they are on the 3rd movie of the franchise and have maintained quality storytelling and compelling visuals is impressive. Jim Carrey seems to have put in a lot of work in this one, and Keanu Reeves is always a great addition to a movie. I feel like I would have enjoyed this movie a little more if I were familiar with the post 90s Sonic games. The 2nd is still my favorite of the 3.', ""It was really good. They didn't waste a lot of time and went straight into the stuff we care about. They handled Shadow excellently. I don't want to give too much away, but this was definitely a love letter to the fans. Eggman(s) stole the movie again. Jim Carrey is the perfect Eggman.\n\nI was hoping for one thing to be here, but it wasn't. That's ok though. There was obviously a lot of references to Sonic Adventure 2 and it was cool to see those moments on the big screen\n\nThis movie was a blast and I had a lot of fun watching it.\n\nI'd give it a 8/10. Also, stay for the mid credit and end credit scenes. They are super hype!"", ""Took the kids to see this (just turned 4 and 7) and they both liked it. My daughter was a little scared at first seeing shadow and the earlier scenes but once sonic and the gang showed up she liked it. Think my son and his friends liked it too.\n\nPros- like the super Mario movie, wasn't unnecessary leftism. Stayed kid friendly and didn't push a narrative. There were some adult jokes and modern topic/jokes, but they weren't bad. Not too long. Good overall message of working as a team and not letting anger win\n\nCons- story jumps and it doesn't make sense at times. Once again, kid movie. A few cringe moments and jokes. Jim Carey is a little extra at times. Credit scene not necessary but of course done to continue to extend series and milk it.\n\nOverall a solid 7 I'd say especially in this day and age."", ""I went to see this last night and it didn't disappoint! A lot of action, funny scenes with Jim Carey, heart and surprises. The action in the movie is not like we have seen in previous Sonic movies, the animation is definitely a noticeable upgrade. This is what everyone was looking for in a Sonic movie and they finally hit all the right spots. They took the feedback seriously to take the best parts of the first and second one into the 3rd installment. Credits screen will make your jaw drop. Looking forward to see Sonic movie 4! I will be seeing this again in the movies it was that good, for a kids movie you can't get any better!"", ""My thoughts on Sonic 3\n\nHonestly, Sonic 3 really surprised me. This time, the focus was on Sonic, Shadow, and Eggman, and it immediately took the movie to a whole new level. No unnecessary human characters getting in the way like in the previous parts - the story finally revolves around the main heroes!\n\nWhat I liked: Shadow. This character is just . They finally showed us his backstory, his motives, and his relationship with Maria - all of it was done so well that you actually start to empathize with him. He's not just a villain but a complex character whose development is fascinating to follow.\n\nJim Carrey. No words needed - the man absolutely nailed it. Playing two roles at once is already a tough challenge, but he made them feel so distinct that I genuinely believed they were played by two different actors. The scenes where his characters interact (especially the dance one) were simply top-notch.\n\nThe strongest part of the series. For me, this is the best Sonic movie so far. The plot keeps you hooked, the pacing is great, and the characters are better developed than ever before.\n\nWhat didn't work: The dialogues. This part was rough. It felt like they were written by AI - stiff, unnatural, and strange.\n\nRepetitive plot. This really hurt the overall impression. In the second movie, Knuckles starts out as a villain, then talks with Sonic and becomes his ally. And what do we see here? The exact same formula with Shadow. Writers, seriously?\n\nThe humor between Eggman and his grandfather. These scenes were pure cringe. I was sitting there feeling so awkward I just wanted to disappear. Why was this even included?\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nSonic 3 is definitely a solid movie. 7 out of 10, because despite its flaws, it still holds its ground. Shadow is the standout, Jim Carrey is phenomenal, but I really hope the next installments have a more original storyline.\n\nThe big question now is: what's next? Shadow is peak material, and it'll be hard to come up with someone better. If the creators don't step up their game with a fresh, compelling villain, the franchise risks losing steam. I hope that doesn't happen because Sonic 3 showed just how much potential they have."", ""There was a point where I was torn between whether I liked this or 2 more. Even though I ended up grading this one higher, I nonetheless still feel a little torn over which I prefer. All that aside, this one definitely has the most going for it! The action, the stakes, the introduction of Shadow! All of it works to make this the most ambitious film in the franchise, and it pays off! The biggest problem I had with the first one was how watered down for kids it felt, and while none of these movies ever really escape that, there is a sense that with each movie, there's a growing maturity and respect for the audience that I must appreciate! Overall, while I can't confidently say Sonic 3 is my favorite of the 3 films, it's a testament to how far this franchise has come that it stands likely as the objective best!"", ""PLEAAÀAAAAAAASE WATCH THE MOVIE it's so good, does the sa2 adaptation pretty well has some references from shadow the hedgehog (2005) (*'v'*) (can be seen from trailer) has the fan service obviously, but overall , the pacing for the movie was perfect , everything flowed just right, with scenes that had me gripping my seat !!!!a must watch if you're a sonic fan \\(^^)/ they also have done an amazing job with the models and improved on the animation\\(-V-)/, this movie was the break to a brighter future for sonic (*^V^)/Cant wait for future movies !!!(*/O/) also a awesome post credit scene as always (*/V\\*)"", ""Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is an absolute delight and a thrilling ride from start to finish! The movie successfully captures the charm, humor, and heart that fans have come to love, while taking the franchise to exciting new heights.\n\nThe introduction of fan-favorite characters like Shadow the Hedgehog adds an intense and emotional dynamic to the story is perfect and the balance between action and humor is spot on.\n\nVisually, the film is a masterpiece. The vibrant and detailed animation brings the world of Sonic to life, making every high-speed chase and battle sequence a feast for the eyes.\n\nThe plot is well-paced, with just the right mix of heartfelt moments and epic action. It appeals to both long-time fans of the franchise and newcomers alike, proving once again that Sonic has a timeless appeal.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 is more than just a movie; it's a celebration of everything that makes Sonic a beloved icon. Whether you're here for the laughs, the action, or the nostalgia, this film delivers on all fronts."", ""Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is a film that embraces its video game roots more than ever. For fans of the series, this third installment feels like a love letter to the franchise, staying truer to the lore and characters than its predecessors. It's a film that respects its source material, but its journey is not without a few bumps along the way.\n\nThe introduction of Shadow the Hedgehog is undoubtedly the film's highlight. Shadow is everything you'd hope for-cool, menacing, and enigmatic. His presence commands the screen, and despite being the antagonist, he's a character audiences will find hard not to adore. His dynamic with Sonic is electrifying, brimming with tension and charisma. Meanwhile, Knuckles continues to be a scene-stealer with his brash humor and camaraderie with Sonic. Tails, however, feels underutilized. She's present, but her role lacks the depth and dialogue necessary to stand out against the stronger personalities around her.\n\nOne of the boldest choices in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is giving the human characters, Tom and Maddie, significantly less screen time. While this allows the hedgehog characters to shine, it's a double-edged sword. Tom and Maddie's mission is crucial to the story, but their limited presence leaves their roles feeling underdeveloped compared to previous films. It's a missed opportunity to further explore their relationship with Sonic and the larger narrative.\n\nAction fans are in for a treat. The film delivers on exhilarating battles, showcasing Sonic's iconic speed and Shadow's teleportation in visually spectacular ways. However, it's disappointing that Tails and Knuckles don't get equal moments to showcase their abilities. For fans of these characters, this imbalance may feel like a letdown.\n\nJim Carrey, as Dr. Robotnik (Eggman), is at his most unrestrained here. His performance harks back to his slapstick brilliance of the '90s and early 2000s, channeling the same energy as his roles in The Mask and Ace Ventura. For fans of his over-the-top humor, this is a delight. However, this exaggerated style might feel grating to those who prefer a more subdued approach.\n\nThe film does falter in the middle act. The focus shifts heavily to Eggman and a new character, pulling attention away from Sonic and the hedgehogs. This segment is bogged down by repetitive jokes and a slower pace, which can feel tedious. It's a noticeable dip in momentum that interrupts the film's flow.\n\nAs the story hurtles toward its conclusion, things spiral into the absurd. The humor and action reach a level of ridiculousness that may polarize audiences. While some might enjoy the chaotic energy, others might find the tonal shift jarring, especially compared to the grounded first act.\n\nVerdict: This is a thrilling ride that captures the heart of the franchise while delivering high-octane action and fan-favorite characters. Shadow steals the show, and the respect for the game's lore is commendable. However, some parts of the movie feel rushed, while others drag on too long. Certain characters don't get the attention they deserve, and the movie's tone shifts in ways that might feel a bit off. For die-hard fans, it's a must-watch, but casual viewers may find themselves wishing for a more balanced adventure."", ""From hedgehogs fighting to Jim Carey dancing with Jim Carey this movie has got to be the best movie I've seen all year!\n\nI've never felt so satisfied in being a Sonic fan than I did after this movie! The fan service in this movie was crazy! Its story was faithful to Sonic media. It even included Sonic music! I couldn't ask for anything more.\n\nI see a lot of hate towards the human characters but I don't seem to mind them. Tom and Maddie have some funny scenes that I really enjoyed. They are good help when help is needed.\n\nIt was the perfect length not getting boring at any moment! It's family fun for everyone! I went with 4 of my best friends and we all voted that this movie was a 10/10! This movie tops the first and second by FAR!

There is so much to say about this movie but you will just have to experience it for yourself.\n\nI cannot recommend this movie enough!"", ""I am really surprised that this is getting such great reviews. First of all when you have a movie like this containing a character with super speed you really need to do a scene where everybody and everything is standing still while the speedster is the only one that is moving or things moving in slow motion as in the Flash movie. It worked well in the X men movies with Quicksilver (except in the last one where they hardly did it at all )and it worked well in the first two Sonic movies but here it is totally missing. Most of outdoor action here is happening in the dark and the clear scenery is very low compared to the previous films. The special effects are of high quality but surely not as exciting or as original as the first two movies. There isn't alot of funny stuff here either and most of the characters except the humans got me bored. And i am a person who loved Tranformers one where no humans were present. There are a few half dozens scenes that i liked but this is really a let down compared to the previous movies."", ""This Sonic movie gets off to a bit of a slow start, and certainly Mr. Carrey needs warming up to his... well... upcoming challenge.\n\nBut boy do they deliver!!\n\nThere were lots of excellent moments throughout this Sonic saga entry.

This sense of ownership is apparent for sure in! His saga entry. And especially... The future looks bright!! I! Think they got a lot of rhythm and reps in during the Knuckles series, which I'm now planning to tune into.\n\nFurthermore, watching Jim Carrey once more demonstrate his mastery as a comedic actor... how impossible it is for him to ever deliver anything but hilarity... was spectacular as he plays two roles simultaneously throughout the movie and so *completely* nails it! Towards the end you can tell he doesn't want to stop. This opportunity for him is just a gold mine and he really gets just a bit of a short while on this unbelievably hilarious potential for him.\n\nAnyway!!! Super great movie. I **loved** it. Stay for the credits!!!!!"", ""While Sonic 3 managed to pass the time, it is evident that this movie was more of a fan service movie rather than one with a tangible plot line.\n\nAlthough Jim Carrey and James Marsden looked like they enjoyed playing their role, other characters gave the feeling that they wanted to be somewhere else, which is not a good vibe to get given that the story line is quite railroaded. By that I mean that often once scene jumps to the next but in a way that forgets everything that they previous scene had established. I do realize that you need to be rather creative if you want to make a movie series based off a side-scrolling video game, but Sonic 3 jsut did not deliver for me. Rather, I feel that it would have been a good 45-60 episode than the nearly 2 hours that was on display because there just wasn't enough martial for such script. Or if there was, it got cut out and it shows. One such instance is the lack of character development of Maria."", ""Saw the movie. It was entertaining and kid friendly. Not much different from Sonic 1 or 2 except with the additional characters. I am not sure why people are rating this anything at 8 and above. I would give it a 7 maximum.\n\nThe good: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Shadow were fun.\n\nThe meh: Some scenes with Jim Carrey were really funny. Some fell flat.\n\nThe bad: The plot was put together by A. I. or something.\n\nHonestly i would like a good Sonic movie similar to Super Mario Bros all animated and just set in Sonic's lands and worlds.\n\nDecent movie for kids but as an adult it does not reach the cross generations audiences like Inside Out 2."", 'Again, as I have stated in the pervious SONIC reviews here on imdb, the wife is a HUGE fan of SONIC - both the games and the cartoons. I thought the first film would be a complete waste of my time, but being a good boyfriend at the time (now husband) I indulged her and I surprisingly found it entertaining, same with the sequel. The films are obviously for kids, but you get the sense that there is clear passion and care behind the scenes from director Jeff Fowler and his crew, but also Jim Carrey being the driving force of the franchise with his performance as Doctor Robotnik.\n\nNo one can do over the top like Jim Carrey and make it funny. He is simply someone who elevates the material. His presence just catapults these SONIC films to a higher level. He plays dual roles as Ivo and Gerald Robotnik. Gerald being Ivo\'s grandfather and leader of Project Shadow. It\'s a treat to watch Carrey bounce off himself and react to himself. Also I do appreciate the development of Robotnik over the course of these films. It\'s subtle in SONIC 3, but he exposes his softer side here and there, and the story shows that finding a familial relationship was something he quietly longed for.\n\nLee Majdoub\'s Agent Stone also got some surprising layers to his character. He\'s got more to do in this film and it was a nice surprise to see him get some nuanced scenes.\n\nI think the juggling of the human characters are way better than they were in SONIC 2. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that the script doesn\'t try to force much from James Marsden and Tika Sumpter. It was inevitable that they would eventually take a back seat, and here their involvement was way more seamless.\n\nBen Schwartz, Colleen O\'Shaughnessey and Idris Elba commendably voice their characters well. Keanu Reeves as Shadow carries the weight of the film. The casting of Reeves was a stroke of genius. Reeves clearly did his homework and he absolutely nails what they were aiming for in Shadow. You feel Shadow\'s anger and pain as he emulates a stoic somberness within Reeves\'s voice acting. Shadow\'s back story is mostly faithful with some changes and he sort of anchors the themes of the film. He\'s got tender moments with Alyla Browne\'s Maria Robotnik. I also quite enjoyed the contrast between Schwartz\'s Sonic and Reeves\'s Shadow.\n\nThere are plenty of fan service and eye candy moments that will please the fans. I only knew of them because of how the fans in the audience reacted and my wife who pointed them out.\n\nAgain this is a movie for kids and for SONIC diehards - which I am neither, but I appreciated that director Jeff Fowler and his writers, clearly knew that because we\'re on a third chapter, the younger audience who saw the first film has gotten older and it was appropriate to go a bit ""darker"" with more ""mature"" themes that still cooperates within that kid-friendly territory. Reeves\'s Shadow brings all that into the fold.\n\n7/10.', ""Films always have the possibility of going south, as most franchises do by the time the third film in a series comes out.

Deftly giving audience both what they've wanted and what the story needs to continue without being too goofy, Sonic 3 is a winner right from the start. The film wastes no screen time, at all. There is either action or important dialog throughout the film. Not to mention the callbacks, and general sense of family. Perfect film for the holidays. I won't say much more, there's a lot of spoilers out there, but just go see it. Bring the kids, it's a good film for the whole family.\n\nOverall, highly recommended. I loved it, and I thought the entertainment value in the second film was dwindling for me. Glad they were able to get it back together for this installment.\n\n4 Chaos Emeralds out of 5\n\nP. S. Stay throughout the credits. There are 2 post credit scenes that you will not want to miss!"", ""My memories of the first two Sonic films are a bit fuzzy, but I recall the initial installment being more entertaining. This time around, Jim Carrey stole the show, bringing much-needed humor to the film. His presence elevates the movie, making it enjoyable despite some shortcomings.\n\nThe franchises family-friendly approach might explain the toned-down action and thrills that would have benefited Shadows' story. While it's great to see more of the iconic characters come to life, I couldn't help but feel that the movie could have benefited from more intense sequences. Longer fighting scenes, prehaps a bit more dramatic.\n\nOverall, Sonic 3 isn't bad, but it falls short of being truly memorable."", 'The Sonic the Hedgehog films are... pleasant. I think that\'s a fair way of putting it. And Sonic the Hedgehog 3 may be the best so far -- for whatever that\'s worth. (It is certainly a rare occurrence that a trilogy actually IMPROVES film by film.)\n\nThe most promising sign for this movie was the significantly lowered billing of James Marsden and Tika Sumpter on the cast list. The previous film understood that nobody wanted to see more of the ""obligatory"" hot-celebrity human protagonists from the first Sonic, instead emphasizing the animated critters and Jim Carrey (who is himself as close to ""animated"" as a real-life homo sapien can get) and although Marsden and Sumpter got a boring rom-com wedding B story, it was excusable.\n\nFor this one, however, they\'re straight-up absent for most of the runtime; this movie belongs entirely to Sonic (Ben Schwartz), Tails the Fox (Colleen O\'Shaughnessey), Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba, still hilarious), newcomer Shadow the Hedgehog (a fan favorite here voiced by Keanu Reeves), and Carrey as Dr. ""Eggman"" Robotnik, who is still so good in the role that he makes even the cringiest, most ""How do you do fellow kids"" bits of dialogue actually kind of work, or at least seem natural for this iteration of the character. (He mentions having ""entered the chat"" at one point.)\n\nWe even get to see Carrey act against himself, as Robotnik reunites with his long-lost grandfather. People have likened these scenes to Carrey\'s shifting between various personae in Lemony Snicket\'s A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004), only here the characters get to interact -- through some fairly well-done doppelgänger FX.\n\nAs for how this film will play for long-time admirers of the Sega games, I have it on good authority that several screenings have erupted with applause, cheer, and laughter; the scenes with Shadow have been particularly exciting to both the kids in the audience and whatever passes for adults in the Sonic fandom. They even kept his gun and the grimdark backstory. Now you\'ve GOT to go see it.', ""1994 baby here, Been a Sonic fan all my life, played all the games, watched all the cartoons, read the comics. I went into this movie with high hopes, and left not disappointed at all. I laughed, I smiled, and maybe almost a tear. The references in this movie are great, the action was so so good, and the soundtrack was amazing. Lots of call backs.\n\nSA2B is my favorite Sonic game, and for them to take quite a bit of that and use it here in this movie, was the best choice they could have made. Is it 100% based of the games? No. But did I feel like a kid again? Yes. Idk how they can make another Sonic movie that is remotely close to this, but if they make one that is this good or better, count me in.\n\nThis movie had a few spots in it that I wasn't to interested in, but that's just my own personal opinion. Great movie. Seeing it again in 4D."", ""Sonic and the gang wre back for round 3, as is director Jeff Fowler who directed the first 2 movies as well as an episode of the Knuckles tv show.\n\nPicking up fairly soon after the events of Sonic 2 (or immediately after it if you take into account the post credits scene of 2). Sonic 3 sees a new bad guy hedgehog... SHADOW (voiced effortlessly cool by Keanu Reeves.\n\nShadow teams up with not one but TWO Dr Robotniks (both played by Jim Carey).\n\nSo Sonic, Tails (voiced by Colleen O'Shauhnessy) and Knuckles (voiced brilliantly again by Idris Elba) have to do a thing and go to place to get a Macguffin to stop the bad guys, save the world.... And who knows... Maybe learn a thing or two about team work along the way.\n\nWhole voice cast is great, Keanu great, voice and vibe fits the visual for shadow (pretty sure there's a nod to a matrix fight scene also)\n\nIdris is great again as the loveable of slightly naive Knuckles (shades of Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy)...\n\nCome to think of it....\n\nSonic is Star Lord Knuckles is Drax Tails would be.... Mantis....?\n\nJames Marsden is back as Tom aka donut lord (but hes in this much less than the other 2 it feels like)\n\nKirsten Ritter is here also but shes completely wasted, makes me wonder if she has more scenes on the cutting room floor.\n\nOpening (and a lot of the movie) is actually similar to X2, there's also a Stranger Things Eleven vibe with Shadow.\n\n(also there's elements of Man of Steel in there too, world engine, flying fist fight scene)\n\nThink its safe to day the sonic movies ste the best video game to movie adaptations....\n\nAFAIK there's only one other video game franchise that's had 3 or movies (without rebooting), and that's Resident Evil.\n\nAs much as those movies have their fans (myself among them), you have to admit, the quality of those movies is.... Varied.\n\nLet me know in the comments... Are the Sonic movies the best video game to movie adaptations?\n\nCGI is pretty good.... There wasn't any shots or scenes that stood out as being obviously bad cgi\n\nThere are 2 post credit scenes (1 mid, 1 at the very end) and both are worth sticking around for..\n\nSomething else that's totally worth it... Is a wee sub to the channel\n\nThis one, even more than the first 2, is the Jim Carey show.\n\nIf you liked the first 2 (and specifically liked Jim Careys schtik) you'll like sonic 3.\n\nIf you liked the first 2 but thought Jim Carey was a bit much.... You'll maybe have less of a good time with Sonic 3.\n\nIts a kids movie, based on a video game. It knows what it is, it doesn't pretend to be (or try to be) anything else.\n\nIm gonna give it s 7/10.\n\nIts probably my least fav of the 3, but it's still a good time at the movies with the kids (at the time of recording it's actually the highest rated of the 3 on imdb, buts it's only just beem released so the rating for 3 might change ober the next fee weeks)\n\nIf you wanna see my thoughts on the knuckles tv show you can check it out here, and if you wanna see my Sonic Steelbook collection, you can check it out here (and if theres nothing there yet or ots different videos... It just means I have uploaded those videos yet....\n\n✌🏻"", 'I wasn\'t expecting an adaptation of the beloved game ""Sonic Adventure 2"" into movie form, but it would have been nice if someone at least tried to do so. Or at least tried to make a coherent film that wasn\'t just memes and references stapled together that you can\'t get much enjoyment from unless you are familiar with what is being alluded to.\n\nIt feels like a montage of disconnected scenes from television episodes over multiple seasons rather than a full story. Even the action scenes are spliced together like 10+ minutes of material was removed for every cut. If this was a full 20 episode season of a television show MAYBE every idea could be shown in full, but this is not that.\n\nMovie itself reminds me of robocop 2: 6+ movies of plot mushed into one 2 hour runtime so nothing gets introduced, explored, or finished. It\'s 2 hours of eye-winking references that start and go nowhere.\n\nLike the warcraft movie from 2015 or so, if you aren\'t a fan of the series, you will have ZERO clue what\'s going on or why to care. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 did not have this problem because any references were limited to environmental callbacks, and so didn\'t have to try to shove a video game plot that for all intents and purposes has no similarity to this, a film franchise that is full of baggage not in the games, and goofy humor designed to appeal to kids into one 2 hour movie.\n\nOnce the initial hype goes away I can\'t see this being more well-received than Robocop 2 was. That said, I would rather watch this than any of the other tripe released in the past two years. That\'s not a compliment to this movie though, just a sign of the times that a clearly unfinished, under-budget, disorganized film is better than the ugly, vile-ideology-drenched slop that is the rest of the modern movie landscape.\n\nI would recommend to see it but do not have any expectations.', ""People kept saying this film is so amazing, but it's not. It's just fine. I mean there is some stuff to it I liked, for example, shadow's backstory was quite well done, and I enjoyed that part of it. The action with shadow was very good too. And some of the jokes were really funny. Still, it's a Sonic movie, so it has weird jokes and moments that aren't that funny. And there was a lot of stuff that was not explained and told clearly. And I don't know why people keep saying that Jim Carrey's performance is a masterclass or Oscar bait. It was just Jim Carrey, it was good, but I don't if it was an Oscar performance. I also might have enjoyed it more if I played the games, but I don't know. It was a fine movie; it was better than Sonic 2."", ""The best 2024 movie since 2020 , 2022 and knuckles series . The story was very well done and the characters had a better sense of working together than they did in the first movie when sonic came to earth . The second movie was very outstanding with Dr eggman and knuckles working together. Tails had a great introduction since the first movie end credits . And then they team up with knuckles to save the whole world from Dr eggman who wasn't dead . Shadow had a great vibe. Feeling the loss of Maria who bounded with him in 1974 before she died . If she was Alive she say to shadow . Don't let revenge take control over your heart. And Dr eggmans grandpa was more crazy than him.

While the movie has its moments of charm and action, it doesn't quite hit the same high notes as its predecessors.\n\nThe storyline feels a bit rushed and overcrowded, trying to juggle too many characters and plotlines at once. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles all have their moments, but the addition of new elements feels more like fan service than meaningful storytelling. The humor, which was a highlight in the first two films, doesn't land as consistently this time around, and some jokes feel a bit forced.\n\nVisually, the movie is still impressive, with vibrant CGI and well-executed action sequences. However, the heart that made the first two movies so endearing feels somewhat diluted. It's clear the creators aimed to scale things up, but bigger doesn't always mean better.\n\nOverall, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is an okay watch, particularly for hardcore fans of the series. However, for casual viewers, it may feel like it's spinning its wheels rather than blazing a new trail. It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't quite capture the magic of the earlier entries. A solid 6/10."", ""To put it in layman's terms, sonic 3 is great. All of the issues of the previous ones were fixed and they made an amazing movie as an result. The plot is something straight out of the games (most of it comes from Sonic Adventure 2) as opposed to the road trip style journeys of the previous 2. Shadow is fantastic, played beautifully by Keanu Reeves in a role he sinks into. He poses a great threat to our heros, mainly the core 3 as the human characters (minus robotnik and his grandpa) take a big backseat; Maddie and tom only are in the movie for like 15 minutes and are only involved with a plan in the middle. It's very rarely the 3rd movie is the best in a trilogy, but this will stand as a prime example of that."", ""Loved the movie, but Shadow's screen time felt too short for such an iconic character. I understand it's aimed at kids, but with Sonic's massive fanbase, especially Shadow fans, I hoped for a more serious tone, similar to the anime. Sonic was great, but his character could also benefit from some maturity. The acting of Tom and his wife felt overly childish and exaggerated, which was frustrating to watch. While the movie had its moments, it reminded me of Spider-Man: No Way Home-but a much more childish version. There's so much potential here. Hopefully, the fourth movie will be more serious and deliver on its promise."", 'Rating - 7.3: Overall, a pretty good family comedy that is carried by its silly humor, action sequences, and performances from Jim Carrey, Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, and Keanu Reeves; I also really enjoyed how the movie drew a lot of inspiration from one of the franchise\'s best games, ""Sonic Adventure 2"".\n\nDirection - Pretty Good: The direction on a macroscale is pretty fun, as it creates this gaming action-comedy that is pretty true to the Sonic games; The direction on a microscale is decent, as it has the silly comedy moments Sonic is known for and tackles some darker, more mature themes that you do not see as much in a family movie; The storytelling is what you would expect from a family movie\n\nStory - Pretty Good: The concept is a continuation of the Sonic the Hedgehog story, with the added Shadow storyline that is true to the video games, particularly ""Sonic Adventure 2""; the plot structure is pretty simple; character writing captures the essence of these characters that is true to the video games\n\nScreenplay - Decent to Pretty Good: The dialogue is pretty and family-oriented, but does get a little mature at points; The humor is very silly and meta, so it\'s what you would expect from both Sonic the Hedgehog and Jim Carrey; The symbolism is somewhat present as the movie touches on familial themes and loss; The foreshadowing is pretty standard because you kind of expect where this movie is going because it\'s made for families\n\nActing - Decent to Pretty Good: Jim Carrey - Good (A very Jim Carrey performance; as you can tell, he has a lot of fun making these movies), Ben Schwartz - Good (It really encapsulates the personality of Sonic), Krysten Ritter - Decent (Typical villain henchman;), James Marsden - Decent to Pretty Good (Plays the human sidekick to Sonic but is given less screen time than the other movies), Tika Sumpter - Decent to Pretty Good (Helps act as the motherly figure in this makeshift family; Has pretty good chemistry with Marsden), Idris Elba - Pretty Good (Plays the monotonous, tough-guy nature of Knuckles well;), Keanu Reeves - Pretty Good (Plays the gritty nature of Shadow well; Basically, it\'s just John Wick, but Shadow), Rest of the cast - Decent (Typical family movie background character performances help with establishing the tone and making the movie silly fun)\n\nScore - Decent: It helps establish the tone and does a decent job incorporating classic Sonic themes\n\nSoundtrack - Decent: Enjoyed how they included ""Live and Learn"" as an homage to ""Sonic Adventure 2""\n\nCinematography - Decent: Standard for an action-comedy of this scale;\n\nEditing - Decent: Pretty sound;\n\nSound - Pretty Good: Helped make the action-comedy what it is\n\nVisual Effects - Good: Helped mesh the Sonic characters with the environment as the overall feel makes the movie look like it is in the Sonic universe\n\nCostumes - Pretty Good: Helps make the Roboniks look like their video game characters;\n\nPacing - Pacing is a little on the faster side; but there really isn\'t that much plot to go through\n\nClimax - Climax is pretty cool as it pays homage to ""Sonic Adventure 2""\n\nTone - Tone is silly, family comedy that makes this feel like it\'s something from the Sonic franchise;\n\nFinal Notes - Really enjoyed the homages to the Sonic franchise and *Sonic Adventure 2*;', 'It is rare that a trilogy releases, but it is rearer that the number is the best, this is truly the trilogy of the dacade! The action is awsome, the third act was better than in most of the Avengers movies. The story althoug a little bit chainged fits the movie world and the story it is trying to tell us. The CGI is best of the best, no complaints there. There were surprises all over the place and easter eggs for the true fans. Third this times brings perfection, and it is always nice to hear live and learn on the big screen in theaters. I would recommend this movie to everyone, because it is very fun and enjoyable!', ""The first Sonic movie was decent, I was slightly disappointed with it at first, but it's grown on me a bit over the years, still a 7/10 IMO. I still think it could've been better, but it's still a decent intro to the series. Then Sonic 2 came out and I loved it instantly and thought it was an improvement from the first movie in every possible way! Better plot, better comedy, better action, better characters, better EVERYTHING!!! 8/10!\n\nNow we are at Sonic 3 and happy to say, I think it's even better than Sonic 2! The Sonic character arc is better here than ever! Sonic goes through A LOT in this movie!!! Even Shadow's character arc is amazing, and even Robotnik. I think Sonic, Shadow, and Robotnik are the best characters of the whole movie! Shadow was done especially well backstory was done amazingly. I got misty eyed multiple times during the movie.\n\nI do think Sonic 2 was more funny overall, but I'm okay with that, because Sonic 3's story is much more serious and high stakes and doesn't need as much comedy. If anything, I think Sonic 3 could've used less comedy because I enjoy some of the more serious stuff more, but I know it's gotta to appeal to children too, so of course they need to insert more goofy comedy, and I'm okay with that. It still wasn't bad.\n\nThis movie also has the best action of the series, which is not surprising at all. The first fight and last fight were the best! They fight like Dragon Ball Z and it's awesome!!!\n\nI only have two small negatives. The comedy doesn't always hit, but not nearly enough overall to bring the experience as a whole down. Small negative number two, we got robbed of a cool Sonic vs Knuckles fight just for an unfunny joke with my least fav character in this whole Sonic universe.\n\nI really hope this movie makes at least a billion at the box office, because everyone who worked on this movie deserve it. They put some much love and respect in this movie and it shows! You can really tell they respect and love the source material, but still have the talent to make great movies that can stand on their own regardless. That's how it's supposed to be done!!! I'm surprised this does not happen more often for modern adaptions, you'd think it's common sense, but I guess common sense isn't so common nowadays.\n\nI put Sonic 2 and 3 pretty much on the same tier as the most classic Pixar movies, and those IMO are like the best you can make a children's/family cartoony movie. Modern Disney should be taking notes."", 'The SONIC movie franchise had a bit of a rocky start with the whole ""realistic looking Sonic face"" controversy. In an all too rare occurrence, the filmmakers actually listened to the fans, fixed it, and now here we are with SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3. I\'ll just say it, this is my favourite video game movie. The team of the quick-witted Sonic (Ben Schwartz), the tech-savvy Tails (Colleen O\'Shaughnessy), and the bruiser Knuckles (Idris Elba) face a new threat in the form of Shadow (Keanu Reeves), a darker, more powerful version of Sonic that has been locked away in a top-secret government lab for the past 50 years. Think John Wick if he had just one bad day- oh wait, he did. He was badass, even in this. They did a great job incorporating his backstory in this. Despite Jim Carrey saying he\'ll take a break from acting, he\'s back yet again, this time playing two roles: Evil mastermind Ivo ""The Eggman"" Robotnik, AND Gerald Robotnik, his grandfather. This might sound strange, but this might be my favourite role of his. He is gleefully unhinged, and I loved everything he does in this, yes even the dance sequence. He just has great chemistry, with himself. The main problem I\'ve had with the previous movies is still here, but they\'ve dialed it back properly: the human characters. Apart from Robotnik and his trusty assistant Agent Stone (Lee Majdoub), who has some good character development here, the other humans I don\'t really care about. I come to a Sonic movie to see Sonic. They have a small role to play in the plot, but thankfully not as much as the other installments. Saying that, I had an amazing time with this one. It\'s the perfect blend of kids movie, family movie, and nostalgic adult movie. My kind of humour too. Seeing it with an uber fan was fun because he told me a bunch of things the filmmakers snuck in, such as certain songs. It\'s so rare these days to have a franchise get better as it goes. Funny enough, I can only think of JOHN WICK. Even if you don\'t know the video games, I think you\'ll have fun with SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3. Oh yeah, stay until the very end of the credits! The reaction of the audience around me was palpable.', ""The sonic franchise is silly and fun... and it knows that. The movies always manage to keep faithful to it's core/source material during its adaptation, while also still keeping in mind that it's a cartoon/game character brought to life.\n\nSonic, knuckles and tails are all back and in nearly every scene of the movie. A matter of fact, every character in the Sonic cast is brought back with the same personal touch that made them unique in the past flims...\n\nAll while adding Shadow in, dripping coolness and style as he literally Akira slides into a scene. (Somthing the staff were so proud of its shown in a number of trailers or promotions... and they deserve that pride, it's cool!)\n\nAll and all it's a fun movie coming out in a crowded market time for movies. Even with that being said, it's still worth your time!"", 'So, perhaps not an ideal scenario but If I\'m going to see as many films at the cinema as I can in 2025, I\'m going to have to make some decisions like this. I haven\'t actually seen the first or second ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" films but I assumed that it wouldn\'t be so complicated a narrative that I couldn\'t just pick it up (it wasn\'t).\n\nThe happy life of Sonic the Hedgehog (Ben Schwartz) and his new family is upended when Shadow (Keanu Reeves) a second and more powerful alien Hedgehog, who is driven by the loss of a friend in his past, escapes from his cryogenic cell and begins a battle with G. U. N. Thoroughly defeated in their initial encounter, the team make the dangerous choice to team with their sworn enemy Doctor Robotnik (Jim Carrey) as they discover that Robotnik\'s technology is being used by someone else, both to release Shadow and to wage war on G. U. N\n\nI\'ve got to be honest and say that I\'m surprised at how positive the reviews I\'m seeing for the film are. There were several elements of this that I really didn\'t like, chief amongst them was the dual roles for Carrey as Robotnik and his grandfather. I\'m probably not the target audience, I know, but I just found his constant gurning to be tiresome and the weird laser dance break a particular low point. I didn\'t particularly like the pop culture riffing from Sonic either - though generally I was OK with the performances from Schwartz, O\'Shaughnessey and Idris Elba, as Team Sonic and particularly from Keanu Reeves as Shadow.\n\nI could have done without James Marsden and Tiki Sumpter as Team Sonic\'s human parents, though I\'m ready to assume that they played much more important roles in the previous films and so excuses were needed to keep them around in this one. It\'s not until reading the Wikipedia page that I discovered that they are the Wachowski\'s - wild. In fact, any time there was just a human character on screen it was a bit of a drag.\n\nI liked how they work the Chao characters into the film though and enjoyed whatever game references that they could work in.\n\nI did not think that this was good - but there were a few elements of it that at least have me intrigued enough to go on and watch the other two films.', ""STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful\n\nShadow (voiced by Keanu Reeves), escapes from the military installation he's being held in in Tokyo, and a massive push gets under way to get him back under control. Meanwhile, Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz), Knuckles (voiced by Idris Elba) and Tails (voiced by Colleen O Shaughnessey) are up to their usual capers, until they're approached by the military top brass to try and help get Shadow back under control. But to do this, Sonic must enlist the help of his old adversary, Robotnik (Jim Carrey) and his father, Gerald (also played by Jim Carrey), who has his own agenda.\n\nThe Sonic films are obviously proving a successful franchise, and so part three has rolled around. It was always going to at least make it to a third part, and while the rule is that three is the magic number, if enough box office dough is rolling in, odds are there will be more to follow. The third instalment introduces Shadow, basically a dark furred version of Sonic, but with a meaner attitude. Ostensibly an extension of Knuckles, he still gives the film a certain feel of its own.\n\nDirector Jeff Fowler returns to directing duties after the last two films, which probably explains the feeling of saminess that pervades the whole thing. And so the gang are their usual wisecracking, smart-arsey selves, but even for a kid's film and even for Sonic, it's all moving too quickly at a million miles a minute, but maybe the kids won't notice. It all really kicks off, naturally, with the arrival of Jim Carrey, this time in a double role, and so giving him more opportunity to chew the scenery with his zany shenanigans and madcap impressions. Things take a surprising and disconcerting dark turn towards the end, with themes of revenge and inner conflict creeping in uncomfortably. Sonic, as done by Christopher Nolan, it feels.\n\nIf you loved, hated or were indifferent to the last two films, you'll probably feel exactly the same about this third instalment. They do say you should leave it at three, though, and with the introduction of another new character right at the end, it looks like advice this series isn't going to follow. ***"", ""Sonic the Hedgehog has gone on to become an example of how movies are done. The first two movies showed that movies based on video games can be done, as despite the changes made, they were made with care and packed with action, humor, and many references to the games that served as the source material. Sonic 3, the newest movie, continues that tradition, as it goes above and beyond to ensure it does not falter to the curse of the third movie being inferior.\n\nIn this movie, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are up against their greatest challenge, as G. U. N. Asks for their assistance, as Shadow the Hedgehog has escaped from containment and is out for revenge. However, this will be the least of Team Sonic's problems, as Dr. Robotnik is alive, and he has teamed up with his grandfather, Gerald Robotnik, who is just as evil as he is.\n\nMan, let me tell you, this movie is awesome. Ben Swartz, Colleen O'Shaughnessy, and Idris Elba return to voice Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, with the addition of Hollywood legend Keanu Reeves, who is best known for playing Neo in The Matrix, Bill in the Bill and Ted trilogy, and John Wick, providing the voice of Shadow. For the live action actors, Jim Carrey is back as Dr. Robotnik, but here, he is doing double duty as he also plays the role of Gerald. Tom Marsden and Tika Sumpter return to play Tom and Maddie Wachowski, and Alyla Brown does a good job playing Maria in Shadow's flashbacks.\n\nThe acting is good, as Jim nails doing two characters at once, and Keanu fits Shadow perfectly. Also, the plot is a mix of action, drama, and comedy. The only reason I give it nine stars is that some of the humor contains puns that would be hit-or-miss for some people, but Sonic 3 is a movie that has set the bar high, and is worth checking out if you are a fan of Sonic or video games in general."", ""I always say for every cringy joke there's a great moment in these movies, and that certainly holds true for this one. I'll also say the third act of this movie is the best thing in this franchise yet, and I wonder if they can even top it.\n\nIn the 2nd movie Sonic was reckless and Tom gave a speech setting up his arc. In this one, they do a similar setup but it's a bit pushed on. And they kinda keep remembering you about this arc & scene. This doesn't feel that good for a majority of the movie, but in that 3rd act it becomes more natural and pays off greatly, also tying into Shadows story. So maybe something I can look pas on 2nd viewing, but not knowing what was coming it felt forced for a long time.\n\n\n\n\nTom and Maddie are even less in this one, which isn't a bad thing necessarily. They had their part to play and it worked well. I also think Tom was more fun again like in the first movie, because in 2 he was just the loser overshadowed by Randall.\n\n\n\nWhat I'll also say about Shadow though is that I was skeptical about Keanu's VA skills but he does a great job. Shadow really has this sad, deep tone in his voice in this cast of energetic characters (FYI: Knuckles' deep voice is still energetic imo).\n\nOverall I think the beginning and third act of this movie is amazing (great action, emotion, everything), whereas everything in the middle felt a bit less adventurous and fun compared to Sonic 2 (the forced on Sonic arc didn't help either). At least there's not another bar scene though... So in the end I think fans of the last 2 movies and/or games will for sure enjoy this one, and it's up to you if the higher highs than before make it best in the franchise. But especially don't expect to be blown away by how all the lore is gonna be adapted, because I think that's a recipe for disappointment."", ""I really really enjoyed the film. I can't say I loved the first or even the second movie all that much and expected to go into this one with the same reaction.\n\nI walked away loving this one the most. The characters brought some great messages and emotion while also kicking evils booty!\n\nThe niece and nephew weren't excited to go see this and they walked out of the theater excited for the fourth one (they hadn't seen the first two as they must not be sonic fans as I thought they were LOL! But they do love video games.) The song choices in this were fantastic and musical scores were also great.\n\nActing was pretty good with Jim Carrey stealing the show imo. (Not a huge Jim Carrey fan either..) Keanu Reeves did fantastic in voice acting too.\n\nI'd recommend this to all ages! (It does have some curse words but what kid hasn't heard those used before..)"", ""This movie is quite interesting and overall is a decent movie. The effects are great and the quality was quite good. I would say however that the plot was a bit predictable and not really too interesting but the humor and the characters were great and really made the story better Only problem is that Sonic is hella cringe like bro who made these corny ass lines Istg. Like we know the story is about teamwork and shi like you don't need to imply that several times in the movie. Also way to many mentions of love and so on I guess thats the theme of the movie but its just too much man. Other than this the movie was great. The end credit sences were amazing."", 'I really enjoyed Sonic 3. It\'s probably my favorite of the Sonic movies so far. While it\'s not perfect, if you were expecting perfection, maybe you should reconsider-after all, it\'s a Sonic movie. I liked the first two films, and this one builds on what they did but in a better way.\n\nThis movie is clearly aimed at a younger audience, just like the previous ones. So, expect that kind of zany, in-your-face, childlike exposition. For example, there\'s a lot of ""Sonic, you\'re too strong!"" and ""We care about you, we\'re a team!"" moments. Honestly, I didn\'t mind it at all.\n\nShadow is probably my favorite character in the Sonic universe, and he\'s great here. I\'ve always liked his edgy, rebellious nature, especially his moments in the games. Although he doesn\'t drop any F-bombs in this movie, I think it was a missed opportunity. But it still does a solid job with the character. The design is also great-thankfully, we didn\'t get that horrifying Sonic design from the first trailer, which I still think would\'ve been interesting to see in a parallel universe.\n\nKeanu Reeves did a great job voicing Shadow, and I really appreciate his work. If I ever met him, I imagine it\'d play out like the first meeting between Sonic and Shadow in the movie, where they both wonder, ""Why do you look like me?""\n\nBut honestly, the standout character in Sonic 3 isn\'t Shadow-it\'s Dr. Robotnik. Jim Carrey really nails the role here, playing both regular Robotnik and Gerald Robotnik. He seems to have a blast with it, and I honestly think this is some of his best work in a while. I laughed out loud at some of his scenes, something I didn\'t really do with the previous two films. There\'s even a funny dance scene where he shuffles through lasers in a spy mission, which reminded me of how I dance at clubs. It was hilarious and unexpected.\n\nThat being said, there are a few moments in the story that had me scratching my head. You can overlook a lot of it, especially since the film is clearly aimed at younger audiences, but there are times when problems get solved too conveniently. For example, characters will be stuck on a problem, and then out of nowhere, it\'s solved without explanation. There\'s also some teleportation and personality shifts that feel a little too quick and easy.\n\nOne scene that stood out to me was how a character, trying to infiltrate a locked-down building, uses the line ""Do you want me to get you fired?"" and suddenly gets access. That seemed pretty implausible. Also, there\'s a robotic crab that\'s supposed to be amphibious, but it\'s destroyed by water in a flooded tunnel, which didn\'t quite make sense.\n\nBut overall, Sonic 3 is a fun ride, with lots of action and great character moments. It builds up momentum early on and has a strong finish. One surprise for me was how empty the theater was on opening night-there was only one other person in the theater with me, which was strange considering how popular these movies usually are.\n\nStill, Sonic 3 is a good movie that works for audiences of all ages, and I had a blast with it. Definitely my favorite of the series so far!', 'After 5 decades, Shadow, another alien hedgehog, escapes his prison and begins to execute his revenge plan. G. U. N. Cannot apprehend him and turns to Sonic and his friends for assistance. Outmatched and overpowered, Sonic must team up with his nemesis, Dr. Robotinic, to stop Shadow and save Earth again.\n\nThis is the third installment of the Sonic franchise, and it is darker than its predecessors. The movie has all the classic Sonic references from the games and some references from the animated series. The story introduces new characters and expands the history of Sonic and aliens on Earth. The story does not entirely explain or share the history, creating some plotholes. Watching the Knucles series before this installment may help clarify the present state of the story and characters. The runtime of one hour and fifty minutes feels long when the movie starts strong but slows down in the middle. With the dark undertones and action sequences, this movie is for older children.', 'Just Got Out of a Screening of Sonic 3\n\n🚫 - The Plotline was Hot Trash, just make Eggman Break Shadow out to team up with him or Make Shadow the Ultimate Near Unstoppable Villain Created by Some Military Company to Capture Sonic, Tails & Knuckles & have them Team Up with Robotnik to Stop Shadow, that\'s it. Anything is better than this.\n\nOn to the Actual Film\n\nPositives -\n\n💥 - 1. This Has the Greatest Action Scenes of all 3 of the Sonic Films.\n\n🎨💥 - 2. Moreover, this Has the Greatest Visuals within those action scenes of the 3 also, there was this specific scene, near some Greek/Roman ruins that was Visually Stunning to watch.\n\n😃 - 3. There was a couple of laughs here and there.\n\nNegatives -\n\n📜 - 1. Not Only was The Plotline Hot trash 👎, it was executed weakly as hell. Shadows Plotline was boring as hell to watch, it doesn\'t matter if it\'s in the games, it\'s boring as hell to watch, and bringing Robotniks Grandfather into this wasn\'t a good idea at all, it watered down the Eggman, it\'s too much.\n\n👎 - 2. Keanu Reeves as Shadow was lackluster as hell, they needed a powerful voice actor to play Shadow, because of this, Shadow was not Optimised at all here.\n\n😐 - 3. So Much of the Comedy was flat compared to the previous films, I was just sitting there thinking ""This isn\'t Funny"". It was awkward as hell at times.\n\nOverall, this was a total Letdown in my opinion, the Plotline was Hot trash, tedious and doing too much. But it does have the Greatest Action Scenes and Visuals of the 3, but Sonic 2 is the Best one for me.', 'So for fifty years, ""GUN"" have kept ""Shadow"" in a gloopy state of stasis deep underground in a top secret facility. All of a sudden he awakens, punches himself out of the place and that means that the director (Krysten Ritter) has to disrupt a family barbecue to engage the services of ""Team Sonic"". Our eponymous blue hedgehog, his best pals ""Tails"" and ""Knuckles"" have settled down to a peaceable life with ""Tom"" (James Marsden) and ""Maddie"" (Tika Sumpter) but realise they have to rise to the occasion so off they go. Imagine their shock, though, when they discover that their new super-fast and super-strong nemesis is another (not quite so blue) hedgehog! Who is he? What\'s going on? Why does he seem to loath mankind, so? Well that all becomes clear when his puppet-master turns out to be the grand-daddy of all baddies. The ultimate ""Robotnik"" - only with a slightly more rotund belly. Matched, even out-matched, it falls to our intrepid team to try and form an alliance of their own, but how will that endure in the face of such terrible odds? Well don\'t go looking for any jeopardy here, indeed what starts off as quite a fun series of thwack and pow escapades showing off the skills of the rivals cannot resist turning into the cul-de-sac of sentimentality as the inevitable plot lines grab hold of the characters and turn them into cheesy mush. I always like a good antagonist, but sadly we just know that however dastardly and evil he - in this case the ultra-hammy Jim Carrey - can be, no writer or director is ever going to let him win, and that\'s pretty efficiently telegraphed right from the start of this sequel that\'s going to be a prequel too, no doubt. Some of the writing is quite fun, with plenty of contemporary and quite sarcastic references to raise a smile, and there are homages paid aplenty to just about everyone from ""007"" and the ""Fantastic Four"" to the ""Avengers"" - but in the end it\'s all just a little too shiny and predicable. It looks great on the big screen though and passes a couple of hours easily enough for a Christmas release, but it\'s all just a bit too derivative for me, sorry.']",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/sonic-3-o-filme/63e3c50d-0a24-49dd-a5ad-8d15d487d5e4.webp

So I've been counting the days and dreading, and when I heard the runtime I was even more distraught. I wanted to hate this movie with every bone in my body for a few reasons.\n\n1. Not a fan of musicals (but I can grimace through them sometimes).\n\n2. I love Wizard of Oz in its purest form and didn't want the legacy of it spoiling.\n\n3. My wife's choices of films are more often than not 'questionable'.\n\n4. Two hours plus in a cinema seat these days doesn't do my back any good at my age.\n\n5. Ariana Grande.\n\nNow being a realist my first impression of the movie might be a little offset because I went in with such low expectations as I've done this before on numerous occasions, but call me a softy in my old age (I'm 47) I absolutley loved it!!! Everything from the phenomenal soundtrack, set design, make up, costumes,comedy elements, character design etc...i could go on, you get the gist. It was brilliant, I may even go watching it again (the highest accolade I can give for a two hours plus movie) and I can't wait for part 2. A few purists have got thier complaints and gripes which there will always be on adaptations of previous pre-loved formats. But no complaints here, just a very good, well made movie. Wizard of Oz's legacy intact.\n\nOne more point...Ariana Grande steals it for me. Perfect casting!!!"", 'I\'m not a fan of musicals. Watching Wicked felt like a challenge doomed to fail from the start. My brother and I made a sort of bet to see who could last longer before walking out mid-session. But to our surprise, not only did we stay until the end-we ended up loving this phenomenon.\n\nThe film isn\'t just a musical spectacle; it\'s a carefully crafted work where everything feels in sync. Despite many sung moments, the story and atmosphere are strong enough to keep you engaged. The emotional core of the movie is Elphaba and Glinda\'s journey. Cynthia Erivo, as Elphaba, is absolutely outstanding. Her performance not only stirs emotion but also builds a genuine connection with the audience. She\'s a character you can root for, and her journey is both inspiring and relatable.\n\nOn the other hand, Ariana Grande\'s Glinda balances humor and eccentricity. At times, her comedic moments are delightful; other times, her attention-seeking antics are irritating. Even so, her charisma and on-screen presence are undeniable.\n\nVisually, Wicked is a masterpiece. The stunning sets pull you straight into the magical world of Oz. The energetic and well-choreographed dance numbers, paired with captivating songs, create a grand spectacle. While musicals aren\'t my thing, the songs play a vital role in telling the story and are undeniably memorable.\n\nAs I watched, I couldn\'t help but compare it to Joker 2, the last musical I endured. That film failed miserably to deliver an engaging story or even decent music. In contrast, Wicked knows how to captivate its audience.\n\nWhat surprised me most about Wicked is its magical and enchanting tone. It feels like something out of Disney\'s golden era of the 80s and 90s-before the studio became a soulless monopoly. Ironically, despite being produced by Universal Pictures, Wicked has more ""Disney magic"" than anything the actual Disney has made in years.\n\nHowever, the film isn\'t without flaws. The friendship between Elphaba and Glinda develops too late, lacking the emotional weight it could have had. Despite the actresses\' chemistry, there aren\'t enough scenes to fully establish their bond. The third act also feels rushed. The first half could\'ve trimmed 20 minutes to allow more time for their relationship and the finale to breathe.\n\nEven with these minor issues, Wicked is a cinematic experience I wholeheartedly recommend. It\'s the kind of movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen and is perfect for family viewing. For someone who dislikes musicals, it\'s impressive to admit that this film won me over completely. It\'s a masterpiece in its genre and a reminder of the magic cinema can achieve when made with heart and passion.\n\nTAKE NOTES, DISNEY!', ""I don't know much about the musical, but I'm familiar with the classic Judy Garland version, The Wizard of Oz. The world-building in this film is the best since Harry Potter and delivers everything you'd want from a fantasy experience. It looks, sounds, and feels exactly as a great fantasy movie should. Ariana Grande brings her own unique personality to Glinda, blending charm with a playful, modern energy that feels fresh and exciting. Cynthia Erivo delivers a powerful and heartfelt performance as Elphaba, infusing the character with raw emotion and a profound sense of strength. Their on-screen chemistry makes every scene between them unforgettable, elevating the story's magic and emotional depth. Can't wait for part two!"", ""If it wasn't for my girlfriend I probably wouldn't have watched this, musicals aren't my thing, but.\n\nThat aside, I really struggle to fault this film. The acting was strong across the board, even Ariana Grande I thought gave a great performance. The production quality and set were infallible. The plot was entertaining and well told. The songs and choreography were impressive even for someone such as myself who isn't usually fussed about such things. One thing that surprised me, was how invested I felt in the world, the world building is very good. It addresses issues similar to those seen in the modern world, but feels so disconnected from the real world it doesn't feel political or like it is pushing a 'message', Which to be honest I was expecting.\n\nAll in all, good film, very long, perhaps could have been shorter. Might even watched the next one."", ""Got to see a few hours ago in IMAX which was magnificent even my sister was there and I'm pretty she loved it! Wicked should be up for awards especially for set design, acting and directing are all great aspects. I'm generally not a fan of musicals but glad I saw this wild ride a couple days before the wide release.\n\nCynthia and Ariana Grande were exceptional throughout they both deserve praise for their performances/exciting vibes! I had a long day I was little achy that was my complication otherwise this was delightful charming gem that will most likely be appreciated by most audiences as should be."", ""I can't quite wrap my head around all the positive comments for this film, they go so far that it is almost suspicious.\n\nAnyway, me and my partner looked at each other after 1 hour and nodded to each other that it was time to leave. The storyline was going nowhere and it was frankly dull. I was really disappointed after reading some of the reviews for it, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't that. It was so predictable that I could sit there and mouth the next line before they even said it, the cinematography was pretty average too, for me there wasn't much to like about it. Perhaps kids would enjoy it more? Sorry but I won't be watching P2."", ""First off... context. I am a hetero male, married to a beautiful wife, have three awesome kids and our whole family is in love with the theater... we go see Peter Pan in Dallas later this month. I say all that to say this... Wicked is easily in my top 5 musicals on Broadway, also holding number 1 of my all time favorite moments in theater (Defying Gravity at the end of Act 1). It would've taken perfection for this movie to attain the level of respect for the movie version.... AND IT WAS PERFECTION! Maybe the greatest movie of all time, definitely the best musical movie of all time.\n\nLet's start with cinematography... Holy Cow! Absolutely stunnin. Colors, camera work, zooms, pans, fades... it doesn't get much better. Even the CGI wasn't distracting.\n\nStory: this movie tells the story of Wicked much better and fluid than the play does... properly so, they have more ways to do it. But it follows the book a little more as well.\n\nCasting: I don't think I've ever seen a movie, short of The Patriot, that every person was perfectly cast... until this one... and not only perfectly cast but embodied the role better than anyone could have. I felt every emotion Elfie was going through, so much that at the end of the movie, I had to catch my breath. Ariana Grande is the funniest Glinda, the Gah is silent, that could have been. She was perfect! Goldblum, Yeoh, Bailey, Slater, Bode played their roles excellently. Even the nod to Keala Settle and Erivo back together since Greatest Showman, nicely done.\n\nMusic: Wow, just wow! Bringing back Schwartz, the original composer with a full theatrical orchestra to pull it off was breath taking multiple times within the movie.\n\nI can't wait for Act 2 next November and this will be purchased the first day it's for digital. Go see it... my words don't do it justice."", 'With the raving reviews surrounding this movie, there was an expectation for so much more. I absolutely adore musicals and I had high hopes for this one. Throughout the progression of the film, I kept waiting for the moment when the movie became an instant classic in my books. Unfortunately, it never did. With a 2-hour and 40-minute run-time, Wicked left me feeling drained. The vocals of the leads were immaculate, the props were grand, but it still felt incomplete.\n\nIn terms of casting, Cynthia Erivo proved to be a wonderful pick for Elphaba, in both acting and singing. She also garnered much sympathy for the plight of her character and the challenges she faced due to her skin-color. Ariana Grande held her own as Glinda bringing various quirks and a unique comedy to her character, especially with her and Erivo\'s chemistry. Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero was surprising and fresh, though it felt as if we never received a deeper understanding of his character. Most of the supporting characters seemed more superficial, and not as easy to connect to. The motivation for the villains seemed incomplete especially when centered around the subplot regarding animals. Every set-up in the movie seemed to lend itself to a set up for another song or ""you\'ll find out in part II.""\n\nThere were moments in the film where it felt rushed, and times that seemed to be drag. Toward the final act, I loathed the idea of hearing another song. The plot seemed increasingly thin and unable to hold my attention. For a musical, most of the songs were forgettable, minus the finishing number \'Defying Gravity.\' Admittedly, not all musicals need to have memorable songs if the plot is strong enough to carry it (e.g. Newsies), but the plot itself seemed just as forgettable. The run-time of the film should have produced a better understanding of the characters and a stronger plot. However, it merely presented a song-fest, with a weak plot and many choreographed dances.\n\nOverall, it is still a watchable movie despite its few flaws and bloated run-time. But there are many others who do believe it is the best piece of cinema ever seen so maybe it\'s just me?', ""Just walked out of Wicked and all I can say is wow. I bought tickets for my wife and I because she is a huge theater fan. I do enjoy the theater myself but not overly enthusiastic. I didn't know much about Wicked except the general plot and man I've been missing out. The film is nothing short of fantastic. Cynthia Erivo is a marvel but Ariana Grande truly steals the show. Every scene she is in I couldn't help but laugh. There is no doubt in my mind that she'll be nominated for an Oscar and hopefully brings it home. The last scene/song by Erivo is breathtaking and I cannot stop thinking about it. Even though it's a bit long at two and a half hours it certainly flies through it and every frame is magnificent. I cannot wait to watch it again."", ""I genuinely wanted to love this film and was so disappointed with it in the end. I really enjoyed the West End play and so was keen to see this version. Boy did it drag. It was about 1 hour too long. The set was lovely, the characters were ok and some of the songs were upbeat enough to engage, but overall it just wasn't captivating enough. I didn't even like most of the musical score. At times it actually made me cringe and I wished for it to end. I know most people seem to love it, but I just couldn't. I tried, but I wanted to escape by the second hour. It was just far too long and not captivating enough to keep me interested."", 'In an era where musicals are deemed unsafe and a guarantee box office poison, Wicked defies gravity and transcends expectations. Not only are the songs infectious and emotionally resonate, but the acting from the cast is equal to the strengths of the music. The movie is visually striking, and though it\'s a lengthy runtime, the journey the viewer goes on is well worth the trip, leaving one enthralled when the ""To Be Continued"" pops up on screen.\n\nWhat is also unheard of for a movie musical is being a two parter. I wouldn\'t be surprised if Wicked: Part 1 sweeps this year\'s awards, and Part 2 does another sweep, something that is unprecedented in the history of movies.', ""The stage play is far more enjoyable; pacing of the storyline and characters you really care about more than in this film. This movie definitely did not need to be a two-parter if the stage play can offer all the storyline and less time. I hope that there is a better cut of this film released when the second half comes out with the whole storyline, not exceeding 2 1/2 hours. These characters in this film seem so superficial. I'm not sure how you can compare this to the stage play. I feel that everything feels so fake in this movie compared to the stage play there could've been better use of all this extended time with more storyline.."", ""For starters, I have seen the original Broadway Play of Wicked and I really like it. I love Wizard of Oz growing up and I thought it was a good interesting take of the world and setting.\n\nAs a film, I was always curious to see how it would be adapted. While I do appreciate it's faithfulness to the source, there are some good aspects but also not so good. Throughout, the costume designs, the production and the sound designs are amazing. It helps to build the world of Oz and create it's vibe. Including the musical score and singing that offers a vibrate, energized and colorful vibe.\n\nHowever, as a whole, the dull presentation and it's stretched out narrative really seems to fail for me to fully engage with it's power. Writing wise, the narrative is interesting but being stretched out and added with unnecessary characters and moments makes it dried up. Causing some of the characters to be boring and not fully engaging.\n\nThe dialogue is pretty bad and there are some poor noticeable uses of CGI that kills away the magical vibe and feel of Oz. Most of the performances are just fine but they never really wowed me in anything particular. Because as a whole, I feel it's a bit overhyped."", ""WOW!!! This film exceeded my expectations. Can we talk about how BLOWN AWAY I was by both Ariana and Cynthia's performances, and honestly the entire cast!\n\nAriana wasn't kidding when she said she put her entire heart and soul into preparing for the role of Glinda. This is a dream come true for her, and I couldn't think of anyone else for this role.\n\nCynthia's belting was out of this world. She stepped into the role of Elphaba with ease.\n\nThe singing was LIVE mind you.... including the stunts.\n\nI will be watching a million times in theaters (and hopefully soon on digital) in anticipation for Part 2!"", ""I was expecting a clown show, what with the marketing and fuss, and was surprised to have found the movie good? The sets are elaborate and the movie was more colorful than I was expecting based off the trailers. The cast was strong and for the most part the singing was excellent. Cynthia Erivo was stand out for me. What a voice! Some strange dance moves here and there. What most intrigued me was the plot. I won't go into spoilers but it made me very interested to know how it comes together in the end. I'll have to watch the final film to determine if this is truly a masterpiece. But I'll say this - I'll be watching."", ""Having grown up with the Wicked soundtrack as a constant companion in my childhood, I had high expectations for the movie. Wicked the movie didn't just meet them, it soared beyond. From the opening number to the final moments, the film captures the magic and emotion of the story I've cherished for years.\n\nThe casting is clearly perfect. The leads deliver incredible vocals and bring Elphaba and Glinda to life, their chemistry making every scene a joy to watch. Their journey from rivals to friends is as heartfelt and moving as ever.\n\nWatching Elphaba defy gravity on the big screen (especially in 3D) is a moment of pure magic that gave me full body chills.\n\nThe music shines brighter than ever. Hearing those iconic songs was a deeply nostalgic and emotional experience for me as well as many others in my theatre.\n\nWicked isn't just a movie; it's a full experience. Its timeless story of friendship, courage, and self-discovery feels as powerful today as it did when I first fell in love with it all. Whether you're a lifelong fan or discovering Wicked for the first time, this is a must-watch.\n\nI walked out of the theater with tears in my eyes, and falling in love with the magic of Wicked all over again!"", ""I really, truly, don't like musicals. If I want to see a play, I'll see a play, I've always thought musical cinema is derivative and cheesy. Wicked isn't really a departure from that thought. I DID find it somewhat watchable, though. If you love musicals, this will probably be a solid 10 for you.\n\nThe production is excellent, the acting is decent, but I'll be damned if I can remember a single song. Unlike the original Wizard of Oz, there really isn't anything to take away, musically. The lyrics are bland, and each song seems like a continuation of the others. With a runtime of nearly 3 hours, it would've been nice to have at least one or two decent songs.\n\nSo, to sum up, you'll love it if you love musicals, and if you don't, you won't."", ""As a theatre kid and long-time lover of The Wizard of Oz and Wicked, I had high hopes for this film and prayed it would be all that and so much more. And that it was!\n\nThe performances, especially by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, are Oscar-worthy. We see a whole new side to their insane talents and what they're truly capable of doing. Throughout the film, I had forgotten that it was Ariana as Glinda, because I saw her fully embody this role in the way that she said she would. She is HYSTERICAL and the whole theater couldn't stop giggling. Cynthia is an absolute powerhouse that left me left speechless after each star-studded performance. Having followed her journey for a while now, it came at no surprise the amazing beauty and strength she gave Elphaba. Together, they were radiating power, friendship and emotion.\n\nThe chemistry of the entire cast was lively and formed an environment that felt ethereal, along with the groundbreaking visuals of the settings! Wow. Just wow. It was beyond believable, and felt as if I was there, immersed in this world of Oz the entire film. And no, the trailers do not do this film justice and they don't spoil ANYTHING!\n\nThe musical numbers were traveling throughout my heart and soul, and it was an out of body experience that I will never forget.\n\nThis deserved two parts, and I see EXACTLY why it was split up. Yes, the film is long, BUT there is never a dull moment that arises. Each scene, each exchange is filled with its own magic.\n\nAriana, Cynthia, Jonathan, Jeff, Michelle, Ethan, Marissa, and the entire cast truly put their own unique twist on the songs, on the characters, all while paying homage to the original and to the Broadway show.\n\nTo Jon, this is what real cinema is. The camerawork and directing was something I had never seen carved. You have shattered the bar and allowed for more creativity to flow through and take over. Transcending time, going above and beyond the status quo and bringing us into the story. You absolutely nailed it and left no room for error. You truly defied gravity.\n\nBravo!"", ""The acting's great, the sets and choreography are spectacular, vibrant and full of colour and there are some great songs (in between them belting out notes for no reason), but it's hard to recommend when so much of it is left unfinished. The light plot fells drawn out, mainly focusing on the relationship between the two leads, with other characters barely used and other plot points never really explained. There's some good humour and attempts at defying traditional expectations but I never felt in awe or amazed at the magical world of Oz and the ending, whilst dramatic, felt rushed.\n\nOverall = 6/10."", ""Wicked: Part I is a spellbinding journey that evokes a whirlwind of emotions-doubt, laughter, hatred, love, tears, and introspection. It masterfully challenges the conventional notions of good and evil, revealing that villains aren't always the true evil, nor are heroes always entirely heroic.\n\nThe music and songs are breathtaking, bridging the gap between Broadway and cinema, though Ariana Grande's vocals occasionally felt overly dramatic and slightly inauthentic. Still, the film delivers a seamless connection between the past and present, creating a deeply emotional and thought-provoking experience.\n\nA stunning adaptation that leaves audiences eagerly anticipating Part II."", ""I've gotta tell I wasn't very excited about this movie, specially with Ariana Grande, but it was a big surprise for me. And the actor who plays Elphaba is also very talented.\n\nApart from the fact I don't think Wicked has the best story line, the movie made the best out of it, in my sincere opinion. Direction is great!\n\nI didn't know they would split it in two, so I was expecting the whole story in this movie, but I think it is better this way, because they can explore all the story, the development of the characters etc.\n\nArt direction is a 10/10. Singing also perfect. Watch it, you won't regret it!"", ""Powerful performances, most moving movie I've seen in years! Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande had breathtaking performances. A wonderful mix of humor and deep connection and emotions. I'm not a musical theater person but I was wonderfully surprised! Jonathan Bailey brings such a charm and lovable nature to Fiyero. The whole cast was phenomenal and it's the most moving film I've seen in years! I will definitely be watching this over and over again. All of the songs were so very pleasant. The sequences to the those scenes are amazing. It was all just... amazing. Something that I think most everyone will be able to connect with."", ""I watched this movie New Year's Eve with my friends and they loved the movie when they saw it in theaters and I thought that I should watch it and is was pretty Good. Ariana Grande did much better than I expected and Cynthia was phenomenal. Defying gravity and popular was my favorite songs from this musical. I don't watch many musical but this one was pretty Good. I loved all the different colors and characters. My one thing about this movie that I didn't really like was how long is was. It just seemed like the movie went on and on. But I get it they had to fit a whole first act into a movie and it paid off for them."", ""There are a few things about this film that just really didn't work for me, but there is also lots to enjoy. On balance it makes for a perfectly watchable and entertaining enough experience, but it could have and should have been so much better.\n\nTo start with the positives, Ariana Grande is absolutely magnificent as Glinda. I was sceptical about her as a leading actress but she really smashes it out of the park. Vocally she is spot on. Her mannerisms and dialogue delivery are perfect. She truly eclipses every other cast member and just is Glinda in every way.\n\nAesthetically in terms of costuming and set design, again I think this film nails it. The commitment to practical sets and a reduction in green screen technology is noticeable and it does create a more engaging look to the film.\n\nFinally the production value of the music numbers is all really solid. Apart from dragging out Defying Gravity for a bit too long, I think the songs are all brilliantly performed and well choreographed.\n\nNow for my gripes...\n\nThe whole thing is just far, far too long. Two hours and forty minutes? There is simply no need. Not only this but somehow, despite all this extra breathing room, the film doesn't carry as much emotion in its story as the theatre production. I felt like the plot points around the animals and also of Elphaba wanting to meet the wizard, just didn't carry as much weight as they should. There was just too much time between the emotional beats of the story due to the added run time, which lessened their impact.\n\nI can't argue that she has a great voice (and she nails Defying Gravity), but I just wasn't convinced by Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba. Perhaps this is on the director's shoulders, but she was just played a little too reserved and shy and was incredibly hard to connect to. I know this is part of the character of Elphaba, but even still the whole performance was just too muted. It doesn't help that she was performing across from a great Glinda.\n\nAnother annoyance is the colour palette of the film which is disappointingly dull. Given the technicolor wonder of The Wizard of Oz, I was hoping this film would pop a little more on the screen. Glinda's pink dresses, Elphaba's green skin, even the Emerald City itself... they just all felt a bit dull.\n\nStill, none of these gripes are terminal. If you enjoyed the stage show of Wicked you will love this film. If you love musicals you will enjoy this film. Even if you are just a casual movie goer you will find plenty to enjoy here. I do just think given the source material there was maybe a better attempt to be had here."", 'I had the pleasure of seeing the Broadway production of Wicked in New York back in 2008. Whilst I had my complaints (specifically around the second act), there was no denying that the music and sets created something magical that I am happy to say Jon Chu has managed to capture with this film.\n\nBoth Erivo and Grande give enchantingly memorable performances as the leads. It was clear both actresses took the time to think about how these characters should transition from stage to film without feeling silly or misrepresented. The supporting characters also all gave strong performances and fit their roles well.\n\nThe production design, costumes, and makeup in this film are all excellent. It does a great job of transporting you to the land of Oz and it was clear there was a huge amount of attention to detail.\n\nThe musical numbers were never not entertaining, with an energy that allowed the choreography and set pieces to shine, as well as the performances.\n\nThis film is only half of the story and ends the same way as Act 1 from the original musical. Similar to Dune, I feel this was poorly advertised, and may leave some people feeling mislead or unsatisfied.\n\nThe CGI in the film is used sparingly (mostly for the animals), but at times did feel distracting.\n\nOverall this was one of the best musicals I have seen in a very long time, and I am excited to see what they do with part 2.', ""2 hours and 40 minutes and this is only Part 1?! Nowhere except for in the cinema did I see the film advertised as PART 1-not in the advertising, not in the cinema listing, and not on the marquee. I don't think I would have gone knowing there were more parts coming. And since Wicked was just as long as a musical and had a beginning, middle, and an end in that same amount of time, it means that they should tell the entire story in about 9 hours. Yes the creativity of the sets and the CGI of animals were amazing, and the leads were pretty good especially since they had big shoes to fill. Cynthia & Ariana held their own, and Ariana may have a second career as she was awesome on SNL as an actor. Jonathan Bailey was a standout for sure, and can obviously sing and dance and came across as completely swoon worthy. Bowen Yang gave the film some camp and humour. But I guess we have a couple of more films to give a solid rating. Is it a 1/10?-no, that's too harsh, maybe not your cup of tea or too long. Is it a 10/10?!-no you might be fanning out on Wicked The Musical, Ariana, or Cynthia a little too much and perhaps you need a restraining order. But somewhere in the middle seems appropriate, until we see the subsequent parts."", ""I haven't stopped thinking about this movie since I went to see it and I've been listening to the soundtrack on repeat.\n\nI went to the touring musical many years ago and don't remember being that enamored with it, but this movie was next level magic. Performances by Cynthia, Ariana, and Jonathan were exceptional. Truly stellar voices! I cry at the end of Defying Gravity every time I listen to it. I hope they win all the awards!\n\nI just bought tickets to see Wicked on Broadway again to compare and I can't wait to see the movie again. I honestly would've sat through a full 5-6 hours to see both parts of it.\n\nSadly the Wicked story is timeless because history continues to repeat itself. There's a lot to learn from it. Highly recommend!"", 'In my opinion, The wicked movie was amazing but it had some parts and scenes that took way too long to end. There were some parts that were amazing and well written and some parts that were kind of corny and badly written. But, I am very impressed with the songs because there was only one song writer. I am also very happy when I found out that the wicked movie songs were written by Stephen Schwartz. Stephen Schwartz was also the writer that wrote the original wicked broadway songs. I am a person with ADHD and usually I cannot sit through a three hour movie, But The wicked movie was so entertaining that I was able to sit through the entire thing.\n\nI think that Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande did a great job acting together. That is my review on Wicked: Part One.\n\nI would give this movie a seven out of Ten.', ""As many people have said and I would agree the vibrancy of the land of Oz didn't come through as well as you would expect.\n\nCynthia, although a fabulous talent, didn't completely draw me in as much as needed to create the sympathy for her character. She was very good but there was just a little something that was off for me. The final song of defying gravity was very strung out and by the end Cynthia's note (which isn't my favourite way of singing it) was very much, come on get it over with please. I think the filming choice did her a disservice on this song.\n\nAriana Grande started off strong and I thought she was going to be excellent however I found she became quite one note as the movie progressed. She had moments of greatness but didn't go all the way for me.\n\nThe whole film was very drawn out, in order to make two movies. This meant it lost the pace and drive that those who have seen the musical will remember. There were periods of time I was board watching.\n\nThe cameos with Menzel and Chenoweth were misguided. I understand the sentiment and the reasoning and as a fan I wanted to see them in this film. However the moment was forced and distracting to the movie. There must have been a better way to showcase them.\n\nJust my personal gripe... Why is Boq taller than Glinda?\n\nThis film had great potential but for me it missed the mark."", ""This is really worth your time. An epic musical version of the story of the fantasy theme oz which combines both the fantasy and musical genre in to an epic result.\n\nMusic in this film occupy most of the film like two thirds of the whole film if i'm not mistaken and although not all the songs were great as there were some average or forgettable songs still there were quite a few excellent themes which brought a smile to the faces.\n\nOne of the few negatives was the film was too long and it more seemed like an extended dvd edition rather than a theatrical version but still it was so enjoyable that u could not really tell how time passed.\n\nOne of the strongest positives was the film was full of intense emotions and full of energy everywhere.\n\nThe three main characters were presented in a great way and the white witch was adorable too and i always love jeff goldbum.\n\nIf u really like a good fantasy musical film then this is for you.\n\nThe film is not perfect by far but it's a very solid effort which keeps u in your seat until the end.\n\nA part 2 is confirmed for a future release so to conclude the story of the evil witch so stay tuned.\n\nGet the dvd and the cd soundtrack in to your collection."", 'I initially watched this movie in a Big D theatre on Monday as part of the Amazon Prime sneak peak. I just finished watching it for the second time and since I have one of those deals where you can watch 3 movies in a week, I will be going again this Sunday. To say that my expectations for this movie were unfair is an understatement...but, I\'ve seen this on staged and listened to the Broadway soundtrack for two decades. But, I can honestly say that this movie went far beyond my high expectations in delivering a movie that is hands down the best book to stage to movie adaptation I\'ve ever watched. As I sat there stunned with the rest of the audience on Monday, the only word I can think of is ""gobsmacked!"" Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were perfectly cast and managed to make Elphaba and Glinda their own while literally paying homage to Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. Grande is exceptional at comedic timing (anyone who\'s watched her on SNL knows she\'s hilarious); but, it\'s when there are more nuanced moments between her Glinda and Erivo\'s Elphaba where she is at her best. And Erivo\'s performance? MIND BLOWING! The depth of emotions she conveys with her eyes are scene stealing! Supporting cast is great but I will not be surprised if both Grande and Erivo nab Oscar nominations for this movie.', 'Oh my, what a fun, beautiful film! I literally smiled through the whole movie.\n\nI purchased Wicked on New Years Eve for my grandsons to watch as a treat. And while watching it, I was mesmerized.\n\nThe songs are fantastic and IMO,Cynthia Erivo steals the show with her singing and presence. Not to take any glory away from the Ariana Grande, who played her role and sang with perfection, simply put, Cynthias singing has more heart. However it has to be said that everyone performs superbly.\n\nThe costumns, set designs and effects are spellbinding. The story is incredible and the underlying messages? Brilliant. I simply cannot wait for part 2. Even my hubby loved every moment !\n\nPlease, do not listen to negative reviews, Wicked is Magic and if you feel like escaping into a fantasy world, this is your ticket !', ""This movie is absolutely insane! I watched it on digital, and I'm telling you, I regret not seeing it on the big screen. The scale of everything is enormous. It's hilarious at first. I couldn't stop laughing at some of the scenes, they were just so clever and funny. But then, towards the end, it gets so much darker and more intense and it caught me off guard. As a man, I almost shed a tear. My wife was bawling. The tone shift was done so well, though, it just worked. Even on my TV, it looked stunning. I can only imagine how epic it must be in a theater. If you have the chance to watch it on the big screen, don't make my mistake - go for it. It's an experience. I'll be taking my family to go and watch the stage play as well soon."", 'This movie is LONG.... And it\'s mind-numbingly so if you do not like musical like myself.\n\nWith that in mind, this movie has broadway roots so ""over the top"" it definitely was in many ways, including in acting. . I know people say Cynthia did well , but her acting fell flat to me among all the other actors. The name of the movie is Wicked, but Grande definitely stole the show. I didn\'t care about the witches struggles and obstacles like I should have . I wasn\'t made to care about that character at all actually, which is strange to me. Usually I tend to root for the underdog characters but I didn\'t root for anyone really.\n\nThe CGI did its job, there were a few good songs. Overall, I was ready to leave at the two hour mark and had to sit there an extra 40 mins.. The silver-lining was that the movie did in fact end and my two eight year old girls did seem to like it even though they were starting to get pretty restless themselves. Again, it\'s a really long movie. They were excited to see there was a second Wicked coming out. I told them their dad can take them.', ""Wicked was excellent. It isn't just a film but an experience from the gorgeous world-building (excluding the not-so-great lighting in the first) and costumes to phenomenal performances. I felt like I was lifted off my seat and transported to Shiz University and Emerald City. All the performances are fantastic, but Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande (which I was skeptical about) are the highlights of the film with their amazing chemistry with each other. They disappeared in the roles with a lot of intensity and vulnerability. Even their eyes alone carried so much emotion. The music is also fantastic. However, once again, Erivo and Grande are the standouts with their beautiful voices, especially when they sing together. I haven't read the book or the musical (which is why my expectations are low), but I did see The Wizard of Oz (a masterpiece btw) and it did feel just as fresh and impactful as the aforementioned movie."", ""I went into this movie expecting big things. Now, the singers were great, and I can't deny the cast's talent, but as far as the timing and pacing of the film, it gets a significant deduction in stars for me.\n\nI don't love musicals, but having written that, I can't say that these productions are something I automatically shy away from.\n\nThree hours is a helluva long time to listen to and watch a movie with so much singing and nearly no dialogue outside of song lyrics.\n\nTo its credit, Wicked is shot cleanly and beautifully, and the balance of singing and character acting gets better, in my opinion, in the second half of the movie."", ""This was made so well. As a lover of the musical, I was scared they were going to ruin something I've loved since I was a child. However, it was everything I wanted it to be. Cast well, vocals were fab and the creation of shiz / oz was amazing. My only criticism is that some of the sound didn't feel mixed quite right. Maybe this was to do with the live singing.\n\nI knew from the first song that I was going to love it. Ari and Cynthia brought so much to the roles. And ballroom scene was heartbreaking but beautiful. I am also loving having a new wicked soundtrack to listen to. So looking forward to part 2 and I know I will crying again from start to finish!"", ""If you are primarily interested in movies without being a fan of the original Wicked musical or this particular IP, I would take these somewhat strangely overwhelming positive reactions with a grain of salt. It's nice to see people enthusiastic about big Hollywood extravaganza but this is far, far, very far away from a masterpiece which is so forcefully implied by many major media outlets. First of all, this being Part 1 with a running time of 160 minutes while the whole original musical was shorter than that, tells you enough about the intentions and corporate machinery behind this project.\n\nThe positive side besides perhaps 2-3 musical numbers being fun and charming are the performances from Cynthia Orivo and Ariana Grande. They have nice chemistry together and they are obviously great singers. Jonathan Bailey also has fun screen presence and I definitely wanted to see a bit more of him. Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum aren't doing that much here, typical paycheck gigs, no more and no less.\n\nStory is fine, I guess. It has super basic messages about acceptance, being true to yourself, standing up and, and... really basic stuff without any ambiguity to it. However, the pacing is atrocious, film dragged at times and an obnoxiously pedestrian editing didn't help at all. After some time, I simply wanted it to end - again, this is Part 1, so spoilers - it won't end until November 2025.\n\nAnd how are the visuals? This is one of the worst looking big studio movies I have seen in a very long time - think Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland mixed with MCU's bland colour grading and horrendous lighting that makes everything artificial, soulless and flat. It's astonishing how even the prettiest practical sets can be demolished with post-production in wrong hands. This is a movie where visual components are crucial, it should create that cinematic and magical sense of wonder - remember beautiful Technicolour vibrancy in 1939s Wizard of Oz? Well, that's replaced with the ugliest colour palette you can find in modern film.\n\nWicked (Part 1!) will be a hit, it's tailored to be, forced into being the ultimate crowd pleaser but the fact that such an unimaginative and borderline lazy and toothless filmmaking is so highly praised, called even a MASTERPIECE, that's the reason why mainstream film industry isn't about art, creativity or originality anymore, it's almost exclusively about corporations creating marketing juggernauts and pleasing the target audience with the safest and the most basic content without the ounce of artistic instincts that are usually needed to mold motion pictures into art. Just like Sir Scorsese once commented on these huge riskless crowd-pleasing corporate events, this is not a cinema, this is something else."", 'This movie is by far one of the best movies of all time. The director is a genius and the actors did an amazong job!!! Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo are not only able to showcase big emotions but also are in a superior league when it comes to vocal performance. Arianas powerful vocals combined with extrodinary vocal control are able to get you to tears as well as the power and pureness of Cynthia Erivos voice. Both of them as well as the other actors are able to push you to tears but also get you to joy. Especially Grande has a great sense of humor and is going to make you laugh throughout the movie!', '**""Wicked"" (2024) Review**\n\nAs a lifelong fan of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" I approached ""Wicked"" with a mix of excitement and trepidation. Directed by Jon M. Chu, this film adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical brings the untold story of the witches of Oz to the big screen with a dazzling display of spectacle and emotion.\n\nFrom the moment Ariana Grande\'s Glinda descends majestically into Munchkinland, the film captivates with its visual splendor. Grande and Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, deliver performances that are both powerful and nuanced. Their chemistry is palpable, particularly in a beautifully understated dance sequence that cements their unlikely friendship.\n\nChu\'s direction shines in the grand musical numbers, reminiscent of his work in ""Crazy Rich Asians"" and ""In the Heights."" The film\'s pacing and perspective keep the audience engaged, drawing us into the fantastical world of Oz without losing sight of the characters\' emotional journeys.\n\nHowever, the film\'s attempt to weave in heavier themes of authoritarianism and oppression feels somewhat forced. While these elements are integral to the story, their execution in the film can feel heavy-handed and detract from the overall energy. Despite this, the film\'s 2-hour and 40-minute runtime flies by, leaving audiences eagerly anticipating the second part, set to release in November 2025.\n\nFor fans of the musical and newcomers alike, ""Wicked"" offers a magical escape into a world of wonder and intrigue. The performances, music, and visual effects combine to create a cinematic experience that is both thrilling and heartwarming. It\'s a must-see for anyone who has ever been enchanted by the land of Oz.', 'Dreadful acting, trite story, characters very predictable. We decided to leave the cinema after 40 minutes as neither of us could bear to watch anymore. The only redeeming features were the special effects of the school, but even these were very similar to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films. My friend and I were very disappointed but drowned our sorrows afterwards so not a complete waste of an evening. Overall - loud, brash, dance sequences far too long and why oh why was there a ""camp"" character? A nod to being politically correct? Such a shame to spoil a wonderful fairy story. Certainly won\'t be bothering to watch part 2.', ""I agree with the other reviewers. This is a masterpiece. I'm also not a fan of musicals but boy am I glad I saw Wicked. You feel sympathy for Elphaba throughout the movie. I almost felt like I could relate to Elphaba. I'm sure many of us can relate to her, being misunderstood and feeling like an outcast. I almost wanted to cry in the beginning of the movie. I was blown away. The special effects, the acting and the cinematic elements to the movie was top notch. I plan to go see it again. I went to go see the early premiere, at first I thought the movie was gonna suck but I was wrong. This movie is magnificent. I liked watching the chemistry between Cynthia and Ariana. They deserve an award for their roles, the acting and the performance was good from beginning to end. I am so glad I went to see this."", ""This movie was amazing, and l the song was stunning.\n\nActors did a really good job, although this movie wasn't boring at all cause Actors voices was great, And I can watch it again.\n\nOverall they did great in this movie, and I can't wait for wicked 2.\n\nAlso this movie is truly masterpiece, and I recommend it so much to anyone who enjoys song, also it was a little long movie but story was perfect, and I wanna watch over and over again, and I gotta say don't miss this beautiful movie, cause you will regret it.\n\nWicked has a potential to be a one of the best movie in this year, although I gotta say it's worth my time to watch it, and I enjoyed every second of it."", ""First of all, how the director missed the most colourful film of the century?? World of Oz is supposed to be full of florescent colours, brightest shades of everything etc. What a waste or cheap work?\n\nI loved Ariana Grande's character, on the other hand someone should zoom out the camera. It was hard to watch those crowded dance scenes in the emerald city. There are some major issues with the timeline of the story and cuts made by the director. We are wasting a giant part of the story yet this is only the FIRST chapter. Felt like we were watching 4th episode or something. I hope the second part will be better."", ""I honestly wasn't expecting to enjoy this film, date night, and not my choice, I went in expecting it to be painful, especially following on from some of the weird interviews the two leads have given.\n\nAfter the sensational opening, I was hooked, that's how you start a film, even I, someone who doesn't like musicals or even a small amount of singing, it was great.\n\nSome of the advertising around this film has been quite amusing, I get the impression that they've had a laugh, it worked.\n\nI can't not comment, it does go on about diversity, and on, and on, but then you'll know that already. If I had one gripe, it's that the film felt a little over long at times, it could perhaps have been condensed down a little bit. I wasn't expecting another one to follow, but I'll be there.\n\nAriana Grande delivered a truly wonderful performance, I wasn't expecting here to have been this good.\n\nHonestly, if you're like me and musicals aren't your thing, fear not, you may end up really getting into it.\n\n8/10."", ""Having seen the original show in London back in 2015, it was a blast seeing this on the big screen. I couldn't imagine seeing Ariana Grande in a lead role and getting entranced by her performance, but both she and Cynthia Erivo knocked their roles out of the park phenomenally. The overall cast are great as well and one can tell the likes of Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum had a blast in their roles.\n\nFor all of the content changes and additions the filmmakers went with, the film is quite well paced for what's essentially an adaptation of the first act from Stephen Schwartz & Winnie Holzman's iconic stage musical. Sure it might have been just as fine being one concise movie on its own, but seeing the themes of prejudicial anarchy, intolerance towards those who are different, unconventional friendship and solidarity triumphing over resentment remain intact and actually keep the film on its toes quite seamlessly. There are so many nods to both the musical and the overall world of Oz that it's hard not to appreciate the immense dedication put on display. If nothing else, there's at least one gorgeous musical number to sing along and dance to after you're out of the theater.\n\nDirector Jon M. Chu has come a long way in his career, from the mediocre atrocities of Step Up and Jem & the Holograms to the critically lauded Crazy Rich Asians and In the Heights (2021). Seeing him helm the screen adaptation of a uniquely ambitious take on the witches from Wizard of Oz is nothing short of miraculous. Here's to the next part coming out next year, may it send us soaring and never bring us down."", 'As a fan of the musical, this Part 1 spent 160 minutes to show how the director made a long-drawn-out film. I don\'t mind adding the characters from the original book, but it is not an excuse to add many details to the side plot and drag this movie to 160 munites.\n\nWhen it comes to the climax, the most disappointing thing for me is also coming. The famous song Defying Gravity was interrupted in the movie (compared with the musical). When my tears came to my eyes, they were stopped by this interruption.\n\nIt is also a good marketing movie, there are a lot of peripheral products that can be purchased and a lot of online social media events. It made this movie come with a ""popular"" atmosphere, which I love to see.\n\nAll in all, this movie is a good-looking musical movie, literally.', ""Overall, the film had a talented cast with some good moments. There was a lot of filler though. It was too long for what actually happened. Cynthia's voice was incredible but a couple songs did not fit her, her acting was alright, not particularly outstanding. Ariana had a few good moments towards the beginning and had good comedic timing. Unfortunately her character and acting fell quite flat during the second half and all I could truly focus on was how sick and frail she looked (poor thing). Jonathon Bailey was great, he gave the best performance in my opinion. The acting was fine from everyone but nothing particularly heart throbbing, it felt like acting, but I guess that's to be expected from a broadway adaptation. It was quite disappointing."", 'To my surprise, ""Wicked"" was my most anticipated film of the year. Sure, movies like ""Deadpool & Wolverine,"" ""Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,"" and ""Beetlejuice Beetlejuice"" held my curiosity and cautious optimism, and I had the same feelings toward ""Wicked"" at first. However, the fantastic trailers won me over to the point where every time they played before another film, I couldn\'t help but get excited. I\'ve never seen the original Broadway show, but the Judy Garland-starring ""The Wizard of Oz"" is my childhood. I even saw its dark yet enchanting unofficial sequel ""Return to Oz"" and Sam Raimi\'s Tim Burton-esque ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" in preparation for this. The hype is real, so I would be upset if it fell flat - but it didn\'t! The film fan and critic in me loved ""Wicked,"" and I\'d like to talk about why.\n\nThe acting and singing were stellar around the board. Cynthia Erivo was spectacular as Elphaba, the titular Wicked Witch of the West. Erivo brought gravitas when portraying the human side of the famous villain, especially considering this film is her origin story. I also can\'t forget Ariana Grande as Glinda. Musicians have always had trouble transitioning into acting, with Eminem\'s performance in ""8 Mile"" almost always in the conversation of artists who succeeded. I\'ve seen Grande in other films before, and her role in ""Hairspray Live!"" was entertaining, but these performances haven\'t proven her as a professional. ""Wicked"" changes that, as this interpretation of Glinda seemed to have Grande in mind from the start, and it\'s better because of it. The rest of the cast performed skillfully, with other standouts being Peter Dinklage as Dr. Dillamond and Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero Tigelaar. Bailey steals the show, as Tigelaar is an incredibly whimsical and hilarious supporting character who may win you over.\n\nI have to give proper recognition to Director Jon M. Chu. He directed this hugely ambitious, large-scale tentpole like a pro, and I respect him for accomplishing this possibly wearying task.\n\nEven though studios nowadays try to hide that these movies are musicals, the trailers didn\'t entirely cover it up. As a musical, it was outstanding. See ""Joker: Folie à Deux,"" this is how you do a musical! All the songs and ensuing musical sequences were extraordinary, with ""The Wizard And I,"" ""Popular,"" and ""Defying Gravity"" being the highlights for me. The songs are paired with impeccable choreography, costume, and set designs from Christopher Scott, Paul Tazewell, and Nathan Crowley.\n\nThe CGI was unbelievable, bringing many elements, including the animals, to stunning life. It enhances the magic feel of this film, and the fact the movie cost $145M overall and had exceptional visuals is jaw-dropping. Speaking of which, I\'m sorry, ""Mega-flop-olis,"" though I still think your visuals are mind-blowing, ""Wicked"" has taken your title as the most impressive film visually this year. It goes without saying that ""Red One"" spending $250M might have resulted in great visuals, but how they spent less here is more commendable.\n\nRegarding the narrative, it wonderfully flips the original Wizard of Oz story on its head. Again, this is the story of how the Wicked Witch of the West came to be. There is a sense that the gleeful characters we knew from the original may have helped the Wicked Witch become her namesake.\n\nAdditionally, I laughed many times. In particular, Erivo, Bailey, and Grande\'s characters have hilarious exchanges that made the entire theater I was in laugh, and I couldn\'t help being part of that crowd. Dana Fox and Winnie Holzman deserve credit for having a remarkable screenplay.\n\nFinally, the runtime was surprisingly well-utilized. Before going into detail, I must mention why I had cautious optimism about this film before the trailers. There are two reasons: this was part one of two, and it runs at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I was unsure if this film would drag or have any unnecessary scenes. After seeing it, I am pleased to report I wasn\'t bored or upset with any of the scenes or pacing decisions. Very few films have this runtime and utilize it flawlessly.\n\nIn conclusion, I fell in love with ""Wicked,"" and it is difficult for me not to. In a year with incredible films, ""Wicked"" manages to stand above most of the rest and is one I feel has a strong chance of winning the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nTechnically, the performances from actors like Erivo and Grande, the breathtaking visuals, M. Chu\'s magnificent direction, the script, and the pacing add to a 10/10 masterpiece.\n\nFor the enjoyment score, we rarely see a film outside of animated features that appeal to all audiences. I believe that younger and older audiences alike will love this absolute treasure. The enjoyment score is a well-deserved 10/10! If this is one of the year\'s best films, ""Gladiator II"" has a long way to go to be the victor of ""Glicked."" This musical is a must-watch in theaters, and I can\'t wait for ""Wicked Part Two""!', ""This is an impressive achievement. A blockbuster musical that works. Wonka sort of fits in that category, but this does everything that Wonka did just better. Everything is bigger and more expansive, and not the least the two leads are just flat out amazing in every way. Similarly to Maleficent it reframes what we thought of as a villain, and reflects them against some of the more contemporary realities and sensibilities. Honestly can't wait for part 2, and I think it's going to be even better. I'm definitely ready for the rebirth of the Hollywood musical! I hope this does well at the Golden Globes."", ""The Wizard of Oz nerd inside of me doesn't know how to handle this, lol. It's truly a breathtaking masterpiece. I might just be embarrassing myself now, but I burst out in tears in that final moment, and I'm a 36 year old dude!! But whatever, it was so beautiful and touching, how could I not!?\n\nWicked is the perfect escape into a world of hope and wonder, something I think humanity really needs nowadays. It's a reminder that no matter how alone you may feel, how invisible and weak you perceive yourself to be, you are stronger than you could ever imagine. This movie is for the misfits, the people who dare to be different and those who do not fit the mold of a 'copy/paste' society. It's truly a wonderful experience I will be revisiting again and again and again."", ""Wicked is truly one of the best movie adaptations of a musical to date. Each character is brought to life with extraordinary depth and passion, setting a new benchmark for performances in musical films.\n\nThe production design is breathtaking, seamlessly blending the whimsical and dark elements of Oz. The musical numbers are impeccably performed, with each song evoking a powerful mix of nostalgia and awe. Whether you're a long-time fan of the musical or new to the story, the movie offers an unforgettable journey that resonates deeply.\n\nEvery detail, from the stunning costumes to the meticulous choreography, feels crafted with immense love and respect for the original work. Wicked doesn't just meet expectations-it soars beyond them, making it a must-watch masterpiece for musical lovers and moviegoers alike!"", ""The singing and dancing in Wicked Part 1 were very good, and the opening was captivating, but the pleasure gradually waned as the movie went on, and on ... and on. By the final ten minutes or so I was praying they would stop singing and just wrap it up. I love music and musicals, so this was an unusual reaction on my part.\n\nBefore going to see this, I hadn't realised it was only part 1. That was a bit disappointing. I also never realised the film was so long. Two hours and forty minutes will delight some, but for me, the story and production weren't tight enough to keep me engaged to the end.\n\nFrom this novice's viewpoint, the editing was done with love rather than with a view to creating a tight film. There were many scenes that would have benefitted from some cuts, without losing any of the overall delight."", 'The Wicked movie adaptation is nothing short of a masterpiece, earning a well-deserved 10/10 for its flawless blend of heart, humor, and dazzling spectacle. Fans of the original Broadway musical will be thrilled to see their beloved story brought to life on the big screen with such care and creativity, while newcomers will be swept away by the enchanting tale of Elphaba and Glinda.\n\nThe performances are truly exceptional. The actors embody their characters with passion and depth, delivering powerful renditions of iconic songs like ""Defying Gravity"" and ""For Good."" The emotional beats hit hard, making you laugh, cry, and cheer as the witches\' intertwined destinies unfold.\n\nVisually, the movie is a marvel. The Emerald City sparkles, the flying sequences are breathtaking, and the costumes and sets are crafted with meticulous attention to detail. Every frame feels like stepping into Oz itself.\n\nIn the end, Wicked is not just a film; it\'s an experience-a celebration of friendship, courage, and self-discovery. Whether you\'re a longtime fan or a first-timer, this movie is bound to leave you spellbound.', ""My cousin and I agreed last week that this would be today's movie. That said, My mood might have been soured a bit this morning. I hadn't realized it was going to be a two-part movie, with the second half delayed until Thanksgiving next year; the MTA clipped me for $15; and the escalator at the theater was out of order, requiring me to climb a lot of long stairs. That said, there was much to admire and much to complain about in this movie version of the first act of the musical show based upon the first of seven novels by Gregory Maguire. It seems that the Wizard of Oz was a fraud (as anyone who had ever read the original book or seen any movie version would know). Therefore anyone who was against him was a Good Guy, slandered by propaganda, and that means the Wicked Witch of the West, who was anything but.\n\nCall it The Musical Wizard of Oz: The College Years, and that's what you have. The casting is excellent. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are great, both in their performances, and their singing. Michelle Yeoh looks fine with white hair. Jeff Goldblum is excellent as a carny sharpster doing a cold read on Miss Erivo as the wizard. That said, once you accept that Miss Erivo is not the bad guy, but the good guy, everything falls into automatic slots of plots, and the question becomes a matter of wondering when she's going to wake up. For a Broadway show, there's no modulation in the musical numbers. Every song is a big song, with no chance for the audience to catch its emotional breath. Most of the numbers are elaborately choreographed..... and then edited into short clips.\n\nFinally, a kind word for the production design by Nathan Crowley, and the art direction under Ben Collins: it's a mixture of Pre-Raphaelite and Beaux Artes in its look, which is clever, effective, and appropriate for a work that is, ultimately, derived from the Mauve Decade.\n\nIn the end, this is not a Great Movie Musical, because so much about it indicates that Hollywood has forgotten the lessons about the form that it learned in the 1930s and 1940s. Neither do I think that there is a market for movie musicals as a regular genre any more. The style of songs that allowed the audiences to come together over a range of songs that extended from 1890 to 1960 has long ceased to be a living language. Musicals still play on Broadway and perhaps tour, but they are revivals, exercises in nostalgia that have to be rewritten because the original books make no sense to young audiences. I had a good time in the theater, which was packed for a 10AM show with an appreciative audience. So call it good, if not great. We'll have to wait a year to see how it all turns out in what my cousin is calling Game of Thrones: The Musical."", ""I rarely leave reviews, but for this I have to! I'm almost too emotional to type. But this is literally one of the best movies I have ever seen. Definitely movie of the decade. I went to see this movie for Cynthia Erivo and left for everyone. When they said this movie had no small parts they weren't lying. As an audience we can truly tell when the cast and crew literally put their whole hearts into this movie. There's a good mixture of comedy, drama, action, and romance. The sets were actually built. The wizard head was real, the train to the Emerald City was real, they built Shiz, and the pond as well. And also to the botanists and the other people that helped, nine million tulips were planted. Absolutely stunning! The costume designs were perfect. Elphaba's green skin was flawless with the freckles. Her nail tech did a wonderful job and my God the wig, nothing else needs to be said about that. Wonderful direction and cinematography. Everything was beautiful and if this movie doesn't sweep the Oscar's it'll be a crime. I was always neutral on Ariana Grande, but she did a stunning job, she truly took care of Glinda. She'll always have a fan in me. Jeff Goldblum is always wonderful. As is Michelle Yeoh. Jonathan Bailey was a delight, Ethan Slater, Marissa Bode, and Peter Dinklage as Dr. Dillamond did well. The supporting cast as well. But more about the movie. I literally didn't find anything wrong with it. Maybe because I love Cynthia Erivo. This movie literally transports you to the world of Oz and I felt like a kid going to Disney World. The soundtrack is amazing. I listen to it every day in my car and can't wait for part two. Since seeing the movie I went back to watch the original movie again. I read the book Wicked and will continue to read the rest of the books in the series and now I'm looking for tickets to see the Broadway play and it's coming to my city this summer. You can say that I'm obsessed, but I'll just say, passionate. I like that word a little better. If you're into musicals and even if you aren't please give this movie a try it won't disappoint. You will leave the theater full of emotions. The ending scene alone is worth a ticket. I could go on and on about this movie but then I'll have written a book myself. Thank you to John M. Chu for directing this wonderful movie. Thank you to every single person that was part of this movie in any capacity. I will cherish this movie for the rest of my life. Cynthia Erivo, baby, I know you'll never see this but I don't care what anybody says about you. They will NEVER make me hate you. That EGOT is coming and I'm giving you your flowers right now! Don't let any person that there is or was ever bring you down!!"", 'Beautiful sets (with lighting), choreography, costumes, and great vocalists who anre more than capable of what is asked of them. It also has solid sound capture, edit, and flow, though there is a heavy-hand on the volume fader - I suspect to wake up the audience periodically as the plot crawls forward. And there\'s the rub - the story drags - this movie lumbers along with no respect for the audience. The movie ends with ""To be continued"", but I have no interest in seeing the next chapter of this director\'s ego trip.\n\nAnd though it\'s a musical, I did not leave the theatre with an earworm. No hooks, just a lot of excess dialogue put to music.\n\nGive it a pass.', ""I had no interest in seeing this movie. But given the positive reception surrounding this movie, I decided to give it a good ole college try. I was impressed to say the least.\n\nThe main highpoint of the movie is the exploration of sisterhood between both Elphaba and Glinda, and how one went down the path of good, and vice versa.\n\nThis was Cynthia Erivo's movie, and I thought she did an admirable job playing Elphaba. She had so many interesting character moments that happened in this film that made her transformation at the end seem believable.\n\nBut...y'all...Ariana Grande was PHENOMENAL! She brought so much life to her character Glinda. Her Comedic Timing, and her Acting were both Amazing! I think after watching this, I'd like to see her act in something else. She get's two Big Thumbs Up from Me! :)\n\nI think for me personally, there weren't alot of songs that stuck out to me. The exception for me would be the song Popular. (saying this after I gushed about Ariana Grande. Hehe) I thought the choreography was on point, and the costume design's were very vibrant.\n\nThe only thing that could've been better is that the runtime could've been shorter. I think there are certain scenes that could've been cut by at least 20 minutes, but that's just my personal preference.\n\nFrom a guy who's not big into musicals, this was impressive. I think the story overall was believable, and entertaining. I will revisit this again before Part II coming in 2025.\n\nSolid B."", ""The minimal use of CGI and actual build sets and impeccable costume design really elevate this to the level of perfection it needed. This could have been cheap but instead everything is impeccable. Ariana and Cynthia are perfect for these roles, the way Cynthia made the battle cry her own... I really thought I heard all possible variations I would like.. then came Cynthia and all other versions pale in comparison. It's everything I wanted it to be, I laughed, I cried, I swooned, I cried and I never wanted it to end. If you don't enjoy this movie I fear we can never agree on anything in life and I don't want to talk to you. I can't wait for the second part. It's a fantastical magical joyride. Everyone deserves a chance to let their emotions fly like this."", ""Absolutely insane. Ariana and Cynthia are perfect for these roles, they were born to do this. I'll never forget all of the feelings this movie made me feel, it was a rollercoaster of emotions in the best way possible. I can't wait to go and watch it again and again!! Perfect for all viewers, fans of the production and those who have never seen it before - it's crafted so well that you will not fail to follow along with the story.\n\nThe audio is fantastic, super crystal clear and you can actually hear every vocal from everyone. This makes such a nice change from some films where you can't hear the voices. I love that they filmed the songs live.\n\nThe production quality is top notch. They spared no dollar/pound and used all of their budget in the best ways possible from costume to the huge sets.\n\nWell done Jon Chu. Not many people could do this the way you do. In fact, I don't think anyone could. Only you. You defy gravity."", ""I would first love to start off by saying that it was a wonderful movie over all and was most enjoyable. I am a person who has been in musical theatre (non-career) and has enjoyed it in many forms. I love it so much. I am an instrumentalist and vocalist (as background).\n\nPros: 1. The set, costumes and visuals!!!! Absolutely stunning and made me super appreciate all the work that everyone put in 2. Obviously biased but the source material 3. Glinda (Arianna Grande). I went into the movie not expecting much of her. Boy did she prove me wrong!!! She was amazing! She played glinda spectacularly. Loved for glinda energy and I'm sure Kristen Chenoworth would have had a way torch to pass on.\n\n4. THE ORCHESTRA. Underrated as anything!!! Support the wonderful orchestra! They did amazing!!!!\n\n5. The relationship with elphaba and fiyero. Is sooo much less awkward then in the musical 😭\n\nCons: 1. Auto tune of the leads.... I understand that because I'm the movie they did live recording of the singing they would've had to tweak it but at some points the autotune was too much. Like some of the unison and harmonies didn't have the timbre of non-autotuned recordings which bugged me (mainly cause I have watched a performance of it live) but regardless I believe I could have been blended together.\n\n2. Elphaba. I will say that Cynthia did a commendable job and I'm glad that she's getting recognition for her amazing voice. All I wish to say is that she changed elphaba's character. Some of my friends who I watched it with (who haven't seen any form of the musical before) found her even annoying to an extent. I was mainly how she reacted to the people around her skin colour. Almost no one mentioned it but yet she had a gipe with everyone. Normal elphaba tries to act above everyone and like she doesn't care (while deep down she does). This makes normal elphaba more likable and justified in her actions.\n\n3. Pacing. I am a very patient person when it comes to long movies. However, I do agree with many comments when they say that it didn't need to be that long. The original musical was about the same length as the movie (aka the first act). They probably could of kept it more concise."", ""What a movie! I was completely blown away. As someone who knows next to nothing about Wicked, I went into this with very little expectations. Prior to seeing this film I had no interest in the world of Oz or any of its characters. Now I am craving more, my thoughts immersed in the fantastical world of this beautiful story.\n\nCynthia Erivo has solidified herself as an elite tier actor in my book. This performance was more than memorable, it was formative to the current era of cinema we are living in. Her portrayal as Elphaba was emotive, sincere, powerful, endearing, and, most importantly, full of love and passion. Her ability to use emotional nuances in her facial expressions in every close up shot had me completely locked in. And, on top of her acting abilities, she has an INCREDIBLE voice. Honestly, her vocal tone is one of the most pleasing to the ear I have ever heard, especially for this style of vocal composition. Absolute stunning performance all around.\n\nAriana Grande also knocked it out of the park with her performance of Glinda. She was spunky, funny, loveably dumb at times, and charmingly self-centered. I didn't know what to expect from her acting as I have only ever known her acting from when she was a teen in Nickelodeon shows. However, this proved to me she has the acting chops to do real films and television, including this movie. She was undeniably one of the best parts of this film. Also, hers vocal talents were already well known, but the training and work she put in to get her vocals to sound like the original Broadway character shines in her delivery of every note.\n\nThe rest of the film had a great cast full of zany and compelling characters. The sets were gorgeous. The costumes were otherworldly but grounded. The pacing was very well executed, especially since this was only the first half of the whole story.\n\nAll that being said, it wasn't a perfect movie. Certain musical pieces didn't work for me, usually those that were in between larger songs or in place of plain dialogue. I felt that some were unnecessary but understand that, being a musical, it is needed for the theme of the genre it's a part of.\n\nI also have always had a weird personal issue with some aesthetic choices of Oz. I've never really liked the vibe of the yellow brick road or Emerald city, or the overuse of greens and yellows in general (this has nothing to do with Elphaba being green, that is something I actually love about her character). Also, the flying monkeys never really seemed to make much sense with fitting in this world, even when I saw the original Wizard of Oz as a kid.\n\nOverall, the movie blew me away. I wasn't expecting much, but I got an immersive world that will be burned into my brain through the next year until we get the conclusion to this tragically beautiful tale. Long live Elphaba. 8.5/10."", ""Soo where should i start? I wasn't planning on seeing this movie, but I was invited, and decided to give it a try with no real expectations, positive or negative. Starting watching it caught me deep into the story which I really enjoyed. Based on that experience, I would definitely recommend it to others. But then came the big question: why was I left feeling so conflicted?\n\nWell the story being so good, it started to really frustrate me, whenever the musical part interrupted it. I am not hating the musical because it was a musical. I am hating it because of the way, they used it.\n\nThey were really nice and funny parts which worked perfectly as musicals in the movie, however, a lot of them, not only extended the movie without purpose but, interrupted the plot. Not fitting into the emotions portrayed before in the scene they really seemed unnecessary.\n\nMusicals are meant to enhance emotions, advance the narrative, or provide comedic relief, but here, they felt repetitive and out of place. Instead of adding value, they often disrupted the momentum and didn't serve the story. In fact, I'd argue the movie would have been stronger without them."", 'The movie is probably a bit too long for what it needed, but overall the film is what you\'d want out of Wicked movie adaption.\n\nCynthia does a great job as Elphaba, capturing the vulnerability, emotions and selflessness, as well as bringing great vocals. Apt casting.\n\nAriana Grande was surprisingly good as Glinda, she isn\'t playing Ariana Grande as Glinda, she is playing Glinda (if that makes sense). Her acting isn\'t cringeworthy or forced and her chemistry with Cynthia is natural and wholesome to watch on screen.\n\nThe supporting cast does a mostly good job, with highlights such as Jeff Goldblum as The Wizard and Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero. However, I do think that Madame Morible was miscast and should\'ve gone to someone who could actually sing, but her non-singing scenes are fine.\n\nThe CGI could have been polished a bit more, but it doesn\'t really detract you out of the movie. Plus, the colour grading of the film is so dull and grey which is ridiculous when this is supposed to be in the same world as the wizard of oz. The set designs and costumes are on point however, it\'s just a shame that in post they\'ve been made to appear more desaturated.\n\nAnd most importantly the soundtrack is amazing, and wonderfully adapted to movie format from the stage show. The recurring musical motifs such as the ""Unlimited"" melody are magical and creates an atmosphere of wonder.\n\nThe musical choreography is visually stimulating & satisfying to watch thanks to great camera movement and expressive performances.\n\nOverall, a great film to end 2024!', ""Just saw Wicked. It wasn't as bad as I expected. There was some culture war content, but it wasn't overdone. I'm still unsure how much I like musicals, but a few songs were surprisingly good, and the set design was impressive.\n\nWhat bothered me most was how the Good Witch was overly ditzy and the Wicked Witch was portrayed too much as a hero, making the characters feel flat. They felt too far from the roles they eventually take on in The Wizard of Oz. The pacing also dragged-cutting 30 minutes of fluff would've made a big difference.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 7/10. Despite its flaws, it held my attention, the acting was solid, and in the end, it was decently fun."", 'It\'s hard when you have to clarify that you like a movie, even if it\'s a musical, without liking musicals.\n\nThere was a lot of discrediting of this movie beforehand, as always, the internet is too massive.\n\nBased on the famous Broadway play, which has been running for more than 20 years, being the fourth longest-running currently and with versions in other English and non-English speaking countries.\n\nIt\'s a really nice surprise. We all know the story of the Wizard of Oz, the story of Dorothy and her fight against the Wicked Witch of the West.\n\nWhat this movie does is something that has been tried a lot in these years in Hollywood, giving another point of view to evil characters to turn them into antiheroes or tragic heroes. This is, in part, what happens in Wicked. However, it is very well carried out and argued that we understand Elphaba\'s motivations and why. I\'m not going to lie, if we go with the ""I don\'t like musicals"" approach, you won\'t like this movie. If you don\'t like the main characters beforehand, you won\'t like it either (no matter how incredible both of them are). And, above all, if an almost 3-hour extension scares you, you won\'t like it either.\n\nHaving clarified all this, I think it\'s necessary to say that this movie is supported by the performances and voices of Ariana Grande (which isn\'t surprising at all) and Cynthia Erivo (which is surprising, and a lot). They have tremendous chemistry on screen and have voices that reach deeply. Ariana has a comedy range very similar to her Nickelodeon beginnings and Cynthia reaches an incredibly absurd level when singing ""Defying Gravity"" that brings tears to your eyes.\n\nThe design is very good, perhaps the transitions are sometimes not very well edited. The rest of the cast is forgettable, except for Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum\'s short time. The visual effects are good, maybe sometimes the color is a bit saturated but nothing serious.\n\nI think it\'s a nice surprise in 2024, especially for someone who doesn\'t like musicals like me (I feel absurd having to always say this to defend my opinion).\n\nLet\'s wait for the second part in 2025...', 'Wow, kind of shocked that I actually liked this since, never having seen the original, I figured it would just be another anti-racism rant accompanied by interminable renditions of Kermit the frog\'s ""It\'s not easy being green"" but it turns out to be more pertinent to anyone that\'s ever taken a stance and quit/were fired, expelled or silenced for their commitment. Never more topical than now, and right on key.\n\nDoesn\'t hurt that Ariana Grande is absolutely luminous as Glinda, stealing the show from Cynthia Erivo who ultimately wins us over with her all-too-human, all-too-understated underdog performance. Especially her cringe-worthy dance scene, which is the crucible in which the strength of Elphaba\'s convictions are forged.\n\nI\'m not a fan of musicals, or musical adaptations for the screen in particular (I\'m looking at you, Les Mis), but where Wicked could succeed on the merits of its songs alone, the movie let\'s more of the story unfold. Let\'s just hope Michelle Yeoh doesn\'t have to sing in the sequel.', ""I know this is an adaptation of the stage play less than the book itself. But, as a fan of the stage play, I was BLOWN AWAY by this movie. They recorded it with live singing which should impress anyone by the sheer talent. Cynthia Erivo was mesmerizing. Ariana Grande was such a surprise to me - knew she was talented - but funny too?\n\nI am obsessed.\n\nI am waiting in anticipation for Part 2. I'm actually a little glad that it is in two parts because I don't want it to be over. I want the world that John Chu brought to life. I was moved to tears several times in a visceral reaction that I did not experience from viewing the stage play - even though I did cry and was impressed by the cast I saw touring in 2021. It could not have been cast better."", 'Wicked is my all time favorite musical. I\'ve seen it 10 times. I love it so much I was worried how it would transfer to screen especially as only half the musical. It did not disappoint! I should have just trusted Jon Chu. He knows musicals inside and out. It stayed true to the musical with a few changes that are more true to the books. As someone who knows the musical backwards and forwards it was fun to see something new. All the actors killed the performances! I laughed out loud at Arianna\'s interpretation of Galinda\'s antics, got chills when Cynthia sang and literally cried during the Oz Dust Ballroom dance scene. The choreography was unreal, especially the use of set design for unique dancing in ""Dancing Through Life."" I can\'t remember a movie I enjoyed this much in the theatre in a long time.']",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/wicked/7217a2cb-22d2-44ff-a9e2-67f43016ed2b.webp

The film captivates with its vibrant visuals, particularly the breathtaking sea, speed boat and sunset.\n\nWhat sets this film apart is its narrative style, utilizing interview voices to weave Pharrell's story within the fabric of the animation. The rhythm of the beat is palpable throughout, making it not just a visual treat but an auditory one as well, creating a deeply immersive experience.\n\nDon't miss it in a cinema. It's made for the big screen with its vivid colours and super sound track played loud!"", 'You might think that Pharrell Williams is too young to have his own documentary biopic. I did too, until I saw PIECE BY PIECE. This is an animated LEGO portrayal of Pharrell\'s life and career, which is the most ""Pharrell"" thing he could do: defying genres as a person and with his music. I\'ve only known him as a musician, but he\'s done so much more as a producer. This movie also shines a light on what music producers actually do. It opened my eyes to just how many huge songs Pharrell and his band The Neptunes had a hand in creating. To name-drop some artists: Gwen Stefani, Kendrick Lamar, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Busta Rhymes, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Missy Elliott, and even Snoop Dogg, who has a very funny joke in this. This movie is directed by Morgan Neville, who won an award for the documentary 20 FEET FROM STARDOM. He does a great job detailing the ups and downs of life. One of the more fascinating aspects of this is how it depicts the way Pharrell listens to music. He has synesthesia, where he can actually see colors in his head while listening to music. This movie has lots of fun small details, due to the LEGO aesthetic. One thing I didn\'t expect to see is the portrayal of loss, especially not the Black Lives Matter movement. Pharrell didn\'t want to make just another regular biopic, it\'s definitely a breath of fresh air that is much more than just a gimmick. Imagination is such a powerful thing. This is a testament to self-belief and being uniquely yourself. If you\'re a Pharrell fan, go see it. If you\'re a LEGO fan, go see it. If you just wanna be happy, go see PIECE BY PIECE.', '6.6/10 (Recommend, but not in theatres)\n\nThis is a mostly family friendly because it\'s a LEGO-esque style movie, but in reality it\'s definitely not geared towards families. Nothing really drew me to this film other than LEGO. I like Pharrell Williams\' music, but he\'s not someone I\'m dying to listen to or see.\n\nI like the style he decided to take in telling his life story. As a LEGO movie you\'re able to create anything you want with whatever your imagination can come up with, but despite the flashy pieces and the catchy tunes that some of us would recognize, it still falls flat. I don\'t feel this biopic is a ""woah is me"" story despite the rags to riches perspective, but the way things are told you don\'t get to truly feel the hardships that Pharrell went through to make it big.\n\nThe film isn\'t a total waste of time. I never realized how big of an impact on music that Pharrell had. Creating music for artists such as Snoop Dogg, Jay Z, Gwen Stefani, and Justin Timberlake to name a few. So I did learn something. I would definitely watch this movie once, but I wouldn\'t see it in theatres if I could go back.\n\nOverall, it\'s a 90 minute surface story that gives only a fractional bit of info on the road Pharrell to make it big. It definitely has a ""go after what you want"" subplot, but you also need to work hard. It\'s a flashy film that uses LEGO, but it never truly hits the emotional chord. I wouldn\'t recommend seeing in theatres, or as a family (unless you like the genre of music). There\'s only one swear word in the film, but it\'s mostly bleeped out except for maybe three times. In the end though you can\'t deny the impact of Pharrell. He\'s had his hand in some of the biggest songs that I\'ve heard, but would never have pegged him to.\n\nThat\'s it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!', ""Saw this at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nFirstly, Pharrell Williams isn't a musician I am very fond of but I have enjoyed some of his works growing up during the 2010s era. With this documentary about his life and career, while it's structure and presentation is standard, the direction and using Lego Animation as a form of storytelling to tell the story of Williams was interesting and definitely something that has never done before.\n\nProvided with interesting interviews, musical score, and discussions from the cast, it's sweet and carries a feel-good vibe to listen to Williams describe his childhood and his passion, and using the Lego Animation style to present it's settings, colorful background, and environment was a very good touch.\n\nI appreciate the filmmaker using a different approach to present this documentary for sure. While it's nothing special, it's cute."", 'Well i had no clue that we owe so much to Pharrell Williams.\n\nAll the music he has been involved with making for 30 years !\n\nIts a lego movie, not your usually type, but interviews with Pharrell and people in his life and who he worked with, all turned into lego in a fantastical type of way.\n\nIts nothing short of excellent.\n\nI learned alot i had no idea about the music industry, and how people work together, and that Pharrell has had his hand is some very successful music over the past few decades.\n\nIt is cleverly done, and the characters even talk about being in a lego movie.\n\nBy the end of the movie the whole cinema was hopping, clapping and singing along. It was mostly kids.', ""The idea of having a Lego movie that documents the life of Pharrell Williams is so unique and creative and it is the type of thing I would love to see more of in Hollywood. The film has some really nice animation and when the animation moves to the music it looks really cool. The movie basically serves as a documentary about Pharrell Williams which is nice and it's really funny seeing all of these legends from the entertainment industry in Lego form, especially Snoop Dogg. In classic Lego movie form this movie has heart and humor, and can be enjoyed by the whole family. I also like how even though this is a Lego movie the film didn't really hold back on some of the more adult elements of Pharrell's story. Morgan Neville did a good job directing and I think this is a pretty solid and entertaining watch."", ""My wife and I watched Piece by Piece (2024) in theaters today. The storyline follows the life of Pharrell Williams, tracing his journey from Virginia Beach to becoming a music icon.\n\nDirected by Morgan Neville (Won't You Be My Neighbor), the film features the voices of Pharrell Williams, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, Gwen Stefani, Pusha T, Busta Rhymes, and more.\n\nThis movie is magical in every way. The storyline delivers powerful life lessons, and Pharrell's journey brings back the nostalgia of popular songs from various eras. The animation is stunning, with the underwater scenes standing out as my personal favorite. The depiction of the characters, Virginia Beach, and the overall universe is vibrant and engaging. The soundtrack is legendary and immerses you in the story, making you want to stay glued to the screen from beginning to end.\n\nIn conclusion, Piece by Piece is an animated cinematic masterpiece that's absolutely worth your time. I'd give it a 10/10 and highly recommend it."", ""Rating: 7.5 Overall, a pretty good movie that opens the possibilities of what stories we can tell through Lego Animation; but, it is basically a biased documentary on Pharrell Williams' life.\n\nDirection: Pretty Good The direction on a macroscale is unique and interesting as they basically had a narratively driven documentary about Pharrell's life but told it through Legos, and used the Lego animation well to help paint the world and show Pharrell's imagination; the direction on a microscale feels like an interview-style documentary, though Pharrell is given space to work with and share his emotions; the storytelling is very similar to other documentaries, though told in a very meta, creative style\n\nStory: Pretty Good The concept is really interesting as it is an interview-style documentary on Pharrell's life, but told through the lens of Lego animation; this movie opens the possibilities of what stories we can tell through Lego Animation; the plot structure follows many interview-style documentaries on a subject's life, but it puts a little too much weight in the wrong places that it feels like it runs out of steam towards the end; it is pretty unclear what is actually factual and what is made up for the movie; the present-day conflict between Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams makes the movie have somewhat of an awkward tension between the two characters; the character writing does not really do a great job at showing the ego of Pharrell because they mention it but kind of brush over it, but it does a good job painting how creative he was; the story feels a little biased because it was clear Pharrell had a big say in what was in this movie, and how his side was presented\n\nScreenplay: Decent The dialogue is very meta and kinda pretentious at times, but besides that, it feels like any other documentary; the humor is pretty good, with them making a lot of jokes that push the rating limit; the symbolism is decent as the movie is a metaphor on how pieces come together to make bigger concepts and aspects of life, why they decided to make this movie with Legos; they try to have this political message towards the end of the movie, but there is barely any time left and they kinda just brush over it, so it felt like they had it just to have it without presenting any nuance; the foreshadowing is alright, but kinda predictable if you know Pharrell's life\n\nActing: Pretty Good Pharrell Williams: Pretty Good (He just plays himself as this is more of a documentary than a narrative; but it definitely shows his personality) Rest of the cast: Pretty Good (Really just interviews from people in Pharrell's life and people he worked with)\n\nScore: Good Helped show Pharrell's personality, and incorporated many of his iconic themes and beats\n\nSoundtrack: Very Good Basically, a Pharrell Williams Greatest Hits album, and it had different songs that influenced his childhood\n\nEditing: Good\n\nSound: Good Incorporated both the music and Lego sound effects well\n\nAnimation: Great Loved the animation, as it opens up the doors for what stories we can tell with Legos\n\nPacing Pacing is not the best, as it feels like it places too much weight on his childhood and early days, that the movie runs out of steam towards the end\n\nClimax The climax is not that well executed as the movie feels like it kind of runs out of steam towards the last 20 minutes; but there is some closure\n\nTone The tone is very documentary in style, with Lego animation flavors."", ""A biopic about Pharrell Williams but it's done with legos, cool and original. But you have to ask your self who was this made for? Cause it's to boring to be a children's movie and most adults would not watch this cause they would think it is a children movie. I watched it my self last night and I found my self quite bored, this biopic being done by Lego was the only thing saving this movie otherwise no one would be interested aside from Pharrell Williams super fans. Also I don't know how focus features have been surviving all year, they're the only movie company where the theater has been consistently empty every time I go even piece by piece only had a total of 5 people. The 2 other movies I've seen by focus features this year the auditorium was completely empty and I was the only person in the audioturm, that's very rare for me to be all by my self in a theater."", ""Piece by Piece is the perfect addition to the LEGO movie franchise. I was so excited for this film since the LEGO movies hold a special place in my heart. I not only grew up playing with LEGOs, and The LEGO Ninjago Movie was my first ever press interview! I love that all the LEGO movies have been so diverse and different. This film is such an innovative approach to the music-documentary genre as it tells Pharell Williams' life story in the form of LEGO bricks. I absolutely love the music, colors, visuals, storytelling, and so much more.\n\nThe film follows the traditional documentary formula -- it starts off examining Pharrell's beginnings. He discovered music at a very young age and instantly felt a strong connection with music beyond just listening to it. He started a band with his friend Chad Hugo who was just as passionate about music; they called themselves the Neptunes. When a record label moved in across the street from them, Pharrell insisted on being heard, and eventually he was. From there his career skyrocketed. He eventually lost himself and his touch as he became obsessed with creating music for people rather than making music for himself. When he reconnected with his sense of self, his career once again went above and beyond. It was Pharrell's idea to utilize LEGOs to tell his story, which I think is such a great choice. The beauty of using LEGOs is that it's free to interpret in any way, and the animators were free to create any world imaginable. The LEGO animation is perfect. I love the sets and other visual creations. Pharrell William is a very important person in the music industry, and I think the choice of LEGOs emphasizes how unique and special his story is. So many other artists have also been a part of his journey -- Gwen Stefani, Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, Justin Timberlake, Daft Punk, Snoop Dog, and many other artists. The cast is incredible and they all voice themselves. Of course, one of the most important aspects of this film is the score. This film takes us back in time with some of Pharrell's greatest hits. Director Morgan Neville captivates the essence of Pharrell's story while making it interesting, fresh, and new for the audience through a completely mesmerizing cinematic experience.\n\nThe film's message is that you can reach any goal you strive for with hard work and perseverance.\n\nI give Piece by Piece 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. You can watch Piece by Piece in theaters October 11, 2024. By Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!"", ""I'm willing to argue working with Britney was actually the big break into mainstream pop for Neptunes and not No Doubt and Gwen. That felt kinda unfair. It's made so that Britney was just one of the many but I think she was THE one to bring Neptunes to wider audience because she had a huuuuge fanbase. Also Clipse and NERD timeline is a bit out of place I think. They were doing their own thing and producing for Clipse long before they became popular. Other than that I think it was beautifully done and so Pharrell coded not to have any vanity at all and portray his huge body of work just by being a Lego figurine."", ""The movie looks very fun and cute from the outside yet once you sit in the chair in a theatre and the lights lower, it becomes nothing more than a snooze fest. My eyes were becoming lower and lower as the movie progresses and never had me engaged. As a fan of both Pharrell and Lego, I imaged this as a new way to interpret someone's life, not a film I'd be counting down the minutes to. I went with my girlfriend, with her and I both excited to watch this, but ended up nearly falling asleep on eachother as this film doesn't have any highs whatsoever. If you're reading this review wondering if you'd like to spend your money to watch this, I can wholeheartedly tell you to skip this watch all together or wait for a digital release."", 'This documentary makes a bold and unusual artistic choice, and while the vibrantly colored bricks lend an undeniable charm, the format ultimately limits the depth of this biography.\n\nAs Pharrell\'s story unfolds, the limitations of this approach become apparent. Dramatic moments that could have benefited from real human expressions seem watered down. The LEGO versions of Pharrell\'s friends and family lack visual nuance, and the audience relies on captions or context to distinguish one LEGO figure from another. For a film about a deeply personal journey, this abstraction creates emotional distance.\n\nThat said, the skill of documentarian Morgan Neville is evident. Known for ""20 Feet From Stardom,"" he deftly follows Pharrell\'s timeline, showing the artist\'s meteoric rise, creative milestones, and boundary-pushing ideas.\n\nThe LEGO animation, while impersonal, offers entertaining reinterpretations of iconic moments, from the ""Happy"" music video, interviews, to his collaborations with Daft Punk. It\'s in these fun moments that Pharrell\'s story becomes a celebration of music and ambition.\n\nHowever, the film focuses too much on the positive. The criticism of Pharrell is brief, and this imbalance begs the question: Was this LEGO documentary another vanity project to stroke his ego and boost his portfolio?\n\nIn the end, the film is a colorful ode to Pharrell\'s creativity, but it lacks the intimacy to make it truly compelling. While LEGO presents a fun lens, the documentary inadvertently avoids emotional resonance and misses the opportunity to build a deeper portrait.', 'Pharrell Williams has decided to tell us a story of his life thus far using Lego as the creative conduit. The Lego bit is quite impressive and creative, the rest of it is really neither here nor there. Perhaps that\'s because he is just too young to present us with a compendium of his achievments. The boy from Virginia Beach lucking out when a big noise producer spots his band ""The Neptunes"" and gives them a chance, his persistence to get noticed, the undulation of his fame, his struggles with success and failure, friendships and family. His increasingly pivotal position in African American culture is all laid out like a yellow brick road, bumps and all, but none of it is particularity interesting. It isn\'t that different from the story that could be told by almost anyone trying to make it in the entertainment industry - actors, singers, musicians. There are the occasional graphics to tell us who is who, but the lego-fication of the animation sometimes makes it quite difficult to tell the characters apart and it does rely on quite a bit of knowledge of the man\'s career and of hip-hop to take much from it. It also doesn\'t really let us appreciate the music. Not that it needed to be a portmanteau of music videos, but the very thing that made and makes him relevant to so many hardly features at all. It\'s an imaginative production to look at, but the substance is lacking on just about every front.', ""Pharrell Williams is one of the most iconic and creative artists of all time. Many generations can recognize his music, but few may know his story. From childhood to becoming a global brand, this is the unique story of Pharrell Williams.\n\nThis is a unique biopic told through Lego animation, which makes it enjoyable for both adults and children. The story does not get into the nitty-gritty of Pharrell's journey through the music industry. It sticks to what inspired him and how he became one of the greatest music producers ever. The animation is colorful and captivating, and with Pharrell's music, it is even better. The movie feels less than one hour and thirty-three minutes, and it will have you tapping your foot and bobbing your head the entire time. This is a great movie to introduce the new generation to some of the hits we grew up with and share the story of someone who has accomplished so much."", 'Pharrell Williams\' journey to success is a remarkable story, filled with lessons about creativity, perseverance, and staying grounded. Piece by piece, his life unfolds as a testament to remembering your roots, embracing who you are, and letting passion drive your purpose.\n\nPharrell\'s story begins in Virginia Beach, where his love for music emerged early. He wasn\'t just a kid fascinated by sounds; he was someone who saw rhythm as a language. This curiosity led him to school bands, where he played the drums and keyboard, meeting Chad Hugo, his future partner in The Neptunes. This partnership wasn\'t born from grandeur but from a shared passion for creating something unique. Pharrell reminds us here to honor the small beginnings-they often hold the seeds of greatness.\n\nAs The Neptunes gained recognition in the late 1990s, Pharrell\'s life changed. Their signature sound redefined music, blending genres like hip-hop, R&B, and pop to create global hits for artists like Britney Spears and Nelly. But even as success came, Pharrell didn\'t lose himself. Instead, he stayed connected to his creative core, consistently pushing boundaries while staying true to his authentic style.\n\nThen came ""Happy,"" the global anthem that cemented Pharrell\'s legacy. This wasn\'t just a song; it was a movement of joy and individuality. Pharrell didn\'t create it for accolades-he created it because it reflected his truth. And perhaps that\'s the biggest lesson: success isn\'t just about reaching the top but.', ""Now admittedly I had no interest in watching a biopic on Pharrell Williams and no it's not because I dislike the guy because I don't, I just didn't seem interesting in the movie. However, the closer I got to the date of this movie, I decided to give this movie a watch and I surprisingly enjoyed the movie.\n\nPositives for Piece by Piece (2024): It was a smart and creative decision to tell the story of Pharrell Williams through Lego animation and I had a lot of fun with this movie. Every scene of this movie was full of energy and I had a blast with the movie. And finally, I really enjoyed hearing from all of these people whether it's people who knew Pharrell Williams before he become famous or people in the music industry.\n\nNegatives for Piece by Piece (2024): This movie is just meant to be fun and nothing else. While that is nice to see, it doesn't pack the punch a lot of other biopics have done in the past. However, if that element is a negative for your movie, then your movie is very good.\n\nOverall, Piece by Piece (2024) is one of the biggest surprises of 2024 and it's a movie I never knew I needed in my life, but I am happy that we have this movie."", 'Piece by Piece:\n\nA biographical documentary in LEGO style! Why didn\'t we think of that before! From childhood to becoming a global brand, this is the unique story of Pharrell Williams. This is a unique biopic told through Lego animation, which makes it enjoyable for both adults and children. The story does not get into the nitty-gritty of Pharrell\'s journey through the music industry.\n\n""Piece by Piece"" is a visually stunning and musically rich experience. The story is both interesting and real, capturing our attention from start to finish. Pharrell\'s music is seamlessly woven into every scene, reminding us of some of his greatest hits. The vibrant colors and unique, sometimes random lights add a cool, distinctive touch. The meticulous detail in each LEGO brick\'s placement, design, and timing is impressive and adds to the movie\'s charm. Additionally, the film\'s clever use of visual metaphors adds depth, making it a truly engaging watch.\n\nScore:7.5/10.', ""It is truly baffling to me that this movie was even made. Why? For what purpose? The movie itself seems to be confused on it's own prompt; it presents itself with the usual, admittedly charming LEGO exterior while acting as a biopic for a, all things considered, irrelevant musician.\n\nConceptually it is confusing, and in it's confused mess it falls flat. However, as always the animation from LEGO is exceedingly well done and the music is fine.\n\nUltimately, the film suffers from a confused premise and a lackluster execution of said premise. It's attempts at sincerity are well mannered but don't feel earned, while the music and animation are well done."", ""I think, before I saw the film, that I'd have told you that I didn't particularly like Pharrell's music that much and truth be told, I only went to see this film because its starting time fitted in with what I wanted to see next - but I was rewarded for taking the chance with a film that admittedly is quite slight, but fun and emotional and, of course, full of music that I did like.\n\nBorn into a housing project in Virginia Beach, Pharrell Williams has a passion for music, stemming from his Synaesthesia - which makes a connection in his brain between music and colours. Together with his friend Chad Hugo they form The Neptunes and are signed to record producer Teddy Riley. Their ability to write amazing hooks makes them in demand as collaborators by higher and higher profile artists. Eventually the Neptunes go their separate ways, and Pharrell begins a solo career. Whilst it has its successes, it also brings a loss of focus and subsequent unhappiness.\n\nThe decision to make the movie a Lego one was an interesting one. I wonder if it's linked to the fact that, perhaps, for all his undoubted talent, Pharrell's life story isn't all that interesting. It is perhaps unlikely, and reliant on the co-incidence that Teddy Riley moved to Virginia Beach but his only real conflict comes from being a victim of his own success. The Lego aspect gives a fun visual sheen to what would otherwise be some rather dry talking head interviews and recreations of his youth. It's particularly useful is showing the Synaesthesia, with his beats created as a physical collection of bricks that can be stored and displayed until their needed.\n\nI liked much more of the music than I thought I did and, despite thinking that perhaps there wasn't much conflict to his life, I did find the story moving at times."", ""First 20-30 minutes I was in awe. The kids even watched. It was amazing. Beautiful, rich Lego worlds. They actually didn't need to do that at all but it definitely helped. So I continued watching and it became softer. They introduced more characters and the story was more on uneventful side. No biggie I thought, I'm SURE it would better!! Well, unfortunately not. In fact it became worse and I had a hard time watching the rest. They introduced more and more people, it was basically a biography documentary by then and they could have done that with real people rather than than the Lego style but I figured they want to do that for people to actually watch. If you are a Pharrell Williams fan then you'll definitely enjoy it, rap/hip-hop helps too but if you aren't into those two then you might as well forget about watching."", 'I liked the other Lego movies that came before this from Warner Brothers, but despite liking the films The Lego Movie (2014), The Lego Batman Movie (2017), The Lego Ninjago Movie (2017), and the sequel The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (2019) Warner Brothers lost the rights and now Universal has the Lego rights; what got me interested in this film was that it was a documentary about Pharrell Williams\'s life told in Lego animation, so it depended on if this concept was going to work or not in order for this film to be good. The Lego movie Piece by Piece (2024) was an entertaining and enjoyable film with an interesting life story of Pharrell Williams, excellent Lego animation, well-done songs that already exist with some new songs, and well-done voice acting; the film was one hour and thirty-three minutes long and I was never bored while watching it, and the Lego animation made the experience more vibrant and fun to watch.\n\nAll the ""characters"" in the film are real celebrities like Pharrell Williams, Gwen Stefani, Snoop Dogg, etcetera voicing Lego versions of themselves telling certain stories they had when they met Pharrell and liked the music he created, so there is not much to the characters, which is why it focuses a lot more on the Lego visuals and what Pharrell\'s story is about; regarding Pharrell\'s story, I found it interesting on how he started as a kid who was called weird to eventually making music for famous pop/rap artists, making his own songs, and just being a well-known person he is today. Lastly, other than the Lego animation showing his life very well, it will also occasionally go back forth between showing the events of his life and showing Lego Pharrell talking to the Lego version of the director of the film interviewing him and other people which done well and still felt like a real interview despite the Lego animation showing it in between the many visuals.\n\nOne of the main things I thought was excellent was the Lego animation, because it was great in showing pretty and creative visuals that replicate how Pharrell sees the world, and it was great to watch just like seeing Lego versions of celebrities, pretty locations with details in a lot of Lego buildings, and the visuals include nice shots of outer space and creative occurrences; the Lego animation did surprisingly well with the Lego animation, and made more invested in his story along with wanting to know more about how he got over certain problems he had in his life when moving up in the world. Last thing I will say is that Pharrell Williams fans will like this film and like the visuals of the Lego animation, for me, I am not a big Pharrell, but I still like his stuff, and the Lego animation added on was nice to see despite already finding his story interesting already.\n\nThe Lego movie Piece by Piece (2024) was an entertaining and enjoyable film with an interesting life story of Pharrell Williams, excellent Lego animation, well-done songs that already exist with some new songs, well-done voice acting, and the film was well put together with how they also used old audio from the past and animate over it; the film was one hour and thirty-three minutes long and I was never bored while watching it, and the Lego animation made the experience more vibrant and fun to watch. To end this off, I had an enjoyable time watching this documentary animated film, with the Lego animation making it even more nice to watch with pretty visuals and a nice message; if you like documentaries, Pharrell Williams, or Lego movies, then you will like this.', ""I was really impressed. Perhaps it's the fact that I went in with low expectations. It probably helped that I hardly knew who Pharrell was before this movie. But I didn't just learn about him, I got to see the world through his eyes. Melville really embraces Pharrell and how he sees life. Of course with any autobiographical account, the story is going to be biased. But if it's going to be told from one side, then at least we should be able to see it from their eyes. And that's what this film does so well. But, while I got to see how Pharrell sees himself, I didn't get to choose how I see him. It was a bit promotional, but hey I'm buying into it."", 'Coming into this movie I knew I\'d like it just because it was another Lego movie.\n\nWhen the story starts going and it\'s not some hero story like emmets, i wondered why I had hopes . Then I remembered it was a bio pic for a great musician. Getting to see how he came to be, learning about the good songs he\'s made, & his struggles was very interesting. The songs with Gwen literally brought goosebumps to my skin. I was enjoying every second of this movie. The grandma part hits home too... she really had a vision for her grandson and the segment where everyone is dancing to the song ""happy"" I knew she would\'ve been proud. I enjoyed this bio pic a lot I hope it doesn\'t get overlooked because of Terrifier 3 or smile 2 coming out a week later. I hope it finds that kid audience or just an audience who loves legos .

For a movie that\'s rated PG, it definitely crossed some lines with its content. Certain scenes were unnecessarily dark and intense for younger audiences, making the rating feel misleading and irresponsible.\n\nOn top of that, the movie was painfully boring. The pacing dragged on endlessly, and it felt like nothing significant ever happened. The dialogue was littered with overcomplicated adjectives and phrases that made the characters sound unnatural, as if the writers were trying too hard to impress. It added nothing to the story and only made the experience more frustrating.\n\nThe plot was a jumbled mess, with no clear direction or payoff. By the end, I was left wondering what the point of it all was. Instead of being entertained, I found myself checking the time repeatedly, wishing it would just end.\n\nThis is not a movie I\'d recommend to anyone-especially not to families looking for a PG-friendly film. It\'s a waste of time and fails on almost every level. Skip it.""', ""No pun intended - sorry for the obvious one!

If you know his journey as a rap producer, to becoming a pop star working with the worlds biggest artists, there is definitely an emotional tug when certain beats drop.\n\nI hope this is still in theatres because this needs to be seen in a setting with a phat sound system.', ""Piece by Piece is an interesting biopic as it tells the life of Pharell Williams through the lens of lego. When I think about history based films, they are pretty much exclusively live action. This is unique by being animated. I do get into music history and try to take in as many films about it as I can. As well as any computer animated film to see how computer animation evolved over time. These lego films do shake up animation as there could be stop motion lego films but there's lego films that are computer animated as it would be easier to animate talking. I feel like computer animation would take less time than stop motion when it comes to lego, so obviously would be a whole movement. The movement has evolved from The Lego Movie to Lego Ninjago to short lego Marvel and DC films to this biopic. I feel like Pharell Williams became more famous more recently with composing for the first 2 Despicable Me movies. Though it's hard to believe that Despicable Me 2 was released 11 years ago and the first 14 years ago. This upcoming year would be 15 for the first and 12 for the second. Still is interesting to see his life."", 'A Masterpiece of Music and Inspiration: ""Piece by Piece"" Featuring Pharrell Williams\n\n""Piece by Piece"" is nothing short of an EXCELLENT documentary that brilliantly captures the essence of Pharrell Williams\' extraordinary journey in the music industry. I had the pleasure of watching this insightful film with my 10-year-old daughter, and it turned out to be an unforgettable experience for both of us.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the documentary immerses viewers in Pharrell\'s vibrant world, showcasing his creative process, unwavering dedication, and the profound impact he has had on contemporary music. The filmmakers have done a remarkable job of blending intimate interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and captivating performances, providing a comprehensive look at Pharrell\'s multifaceted career.\n\nOne of the standout moments for me was watching my daughter recognize and sing along to every song featured in the documentary. Pharrell\'s music has a universal appeal that transcends age, and seeing her connect so deeply with his work was heartwarming. It highlighted the timeless quality of his melodies and lyrics, which resonate with audiences of all generations.\n\nThe documentary delves into Pharrell\'s collaborations with various artists, his role as a producer, and his ventures into fashion and philanthropy. Each segment is thoughtfully crafted, offering insights into his creative genius and the passion that drives him. The personal anecdotes and stories shared by Pharrell himself add a layer of authenticity, making his successes and struggles feel relatable and inspiring.\n\nVisually, ""Piece by Piece"" is stunning. The cinematography captures the energy and dynamism of Pharrell\'s performances, as well as the quieter, more reflective moments that reveal his character and values. The editing is seamless, ensuring a smooth narrative flow that keeps viewers engaged from start to finish.\n\nWhat truly sets this documentary apart is its ability to inspire both young and adult audiences. My daughter was not only entertained but also motivated by Pharrell\'s story of perseverance and creativity. It sparked meaningful conversations between us about following one\'s passions, the importance of hard work, and the power of music to bring people together.\n\nIn conclusion, ""Piece by Piece"" is a brilliant and moving tribute to Pharrell Williams\' legacy. It is a must-watch for music enthusiasts, fans of Pharrell, and anyone seeking a story of artistic excellence and personal growth. Sharing this documentary with my daughter was a brilliant experience that we will cherish, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to others looking for a heartfelt and inspiring film.']",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/peca-por-peca-uma-historia-de-pharrell-williams/e0bacaa7-cdfb-4f99-a9cb-2f8e6cdf58ed.webp

This is ART. The visual, the sound and the score...love it. A depth insight of RM on his journey making his last album before going for his military enlistment. The portray of his genuine feelings on his fame as one of BTS or solo artist and himself as Kim Namjoon. Visually satisfying and the music score very good.

Riding a roller coaster of emotions with him while we are apart by oceans, was one of the the most wonderful experience of my life. Namjoon is like a philosopher and a great story teller who you want to listen to his story for the rest of your life.

I watched the documentary three times, & with each viewing, I felt even closer to RM, his artistry, & the immense influence of his work.\n\nI\'m so grateful that he has found a way to express his art so authentically. This documentary reaffirms why Kim Namjoon is not only the leader of BTS but also a true pioneer. He has literally paved the way for K-pop, fearlessly experimenting with genres & blending art forms. He is, undeniably, ""THE KIM NAMJOON"". 🔥', 'This was a really fascinating look into the whole journey of how RM created his second album. His creativity seems off the charts with exploring different musical genres and working with various musicians and producers. I love that he formed a Team RM to help him through the project - they looked like they were having so much fun throughout the whole process. Seeing and hearing the backstories to the music, the lyrics, the music videos, but especially the filming process to document the project was so interesting. I loved the director\'s decision to have filmed portions in 16mm and Super 8. The juxtaposition of the ""old-timey"" and often out-of-focus looking footage with the modern footage was really cool, even though you know the whole thing was shot over 8 or 9 months.', 'Why follow random people around the world for no reason other than good looks and sex appeal? What has this country come to? RM is hardworking and he deserves stardom, good on him for being successful! But golly! The glazing is HARD with this one. Let\'s not lose more braincells to words we cannot possibly formulate without prior practice and hours of studying a language one wouldn\'t need, ever, by sacrificing our precious time that should be spent doing more productive things, especially when most of the fanbase in India comprises of school going girls. Oh, and apparently porn is bad for your brain but this? Nope, not damaging at all......right?\n\nThis is not to say the music or the band is essentially bad, not at all. Mindlessly dedicating your entire personality to an overseas music group, lighting up anyone who disagrees with your music taste, giving straight up death threats to anyone who says something against the boy band (God, no, that is a cardinal sin) and at the same time deciding whole friend circles based solely on what member they like the most is downright the most ignored form of brain rot ever conceived by humankind. Goddamn, get a life! That is why I rated this movie a 1 star. That\'s right, my only bone to pick with the release of this movie is ""WHY IN INDIA OF ALL PLACES?????""\n\nI\'m sure the documentary is quite good in terms of pacing, substance and filmography (I haven\'t seen it). I\'m all for propagation of cultures across the globe. It is cultist behaviour that pisses me off; not the ones who have a cultist following.', ""I watched the documentary and it pleasantly surprised me. It led me to admire him, respect him. It's not the typical portrait of an idol full of ostentation, dances, and catchy songs. It's a more human work that goes beyond, showing the fragile and vulnerable side of a person like any of us. Kim Namjoon has the ability to make you reflect. It's a kind of therapy, much more than a superficial idol. It leads you to admire him not only as an artist, but also as a human being. It's a profound experience that feels like a conversation with a good friend. Now I understand why so many people connect with his music and with him. I highly recommend that you watch the documentary; you won't regret it, it's really worth it."", 'I love how genuine and candid Namjoon and Team RM were throughout the film and the process of creating the album 👏 RM truly deserves great praise as an artist and a creative spirit 💜seeing an even more authentic and raw version of Namjoon, how it\'s completely different to all other documentaries.

But also grace.\n\nNamjoon felt lost in the spotlights, w/ impostor sindrome at being the literal and figurative voice of a ww band, needed a little perspective & new artsy inspo. Finds a new place in the world, between dreams and reality a great bestie that knows a lot of cool people & cool places to hang out, taking not the role of a mentor but a guide. He wasn\'t quite ready for this wild ride, gets a little over his head, he needs a hug, a vacay & a bottle of whiskey .\n\nRpwp is a cinematic masterpiece that\'s a deep-dive into ""namjoon\'s brain"".\n\nIt was even structured in a way that you felt his journey of feeling lost to him finding his place - feeling like he\'s existing as himself.', ""Rm is a one of the best song writer, singer, producer not even that he is a great group leader.

Watching it was an indescribable experience, one that left me feeling deeply moved, inspired, and incredibly fulfilled. RM has always been an artist who connects on a personal level, and this documentary is a shining testament to his genius and authenticity.\n\nThe film dives into RM\'s creative process, exploring the making of the *RPWP* album and the emotions that shaped it. The concept of ""right people, wrong place"" is so relatable, and through this lens, RM takes us on a journey that is both deeply personal and universally resonant. The way he weaves themes of longing, connection, and introspection into his music is pure brilliance. Watching this, I felt as if RM was speaking directly to my heart, voicing thoughts I didn\'t even know I had.\n\nThe documentary\'s pacing is perfect, blending moments of calm reflection with dynamic studio sessions and vibrant interactions with collaborators. Each segment offers something new-a glimpse of RM\'s introspective nature, his passion for perfection, and his unwavering commitment to his craft. His reflections on life and relationships are particularly powerful, making you ponder your own experiences and the people who have shaped you.\n\nThe songs from *RPWP* are the soul of this documentary. Each track feels like a masterpiece, intricately crafted with poetic lyrics and mesmerizing melodies. RM\'s ability to capture complex emotions in his music is unmatched, and the documentary allows us to witness the raw emotions and tireless effort behind every note and word. From haunting ballads to rhythmic bops, the album is a testament to RM\'s versatility and depth as an artist.\n\nOne of the most striking elements of the documentary is its cinematography. The visuals are stunning, from serene landscapes to the cozy studio spaces where the magic happens. These visuals perfectly complement the themes of the album and create a dreamlike atmosphere that immerses you completely. It felt like I was traveling through RM\'s mind, experiencing his inspirations and thoughts firsthand.\n\nWhat makes this documentary so special is RM\'s vulnerability. He opens up about his struggles with navigating fame, his search for meaning, and his desire to create art that truly matters. His honesty is refreshing, and it\'s impossible not to admire his humility and authenticity. RM isn\'t just an artist; he\'s a thinker, a storyteller, and a human being who\'s unafraid to share his truths.\n\nThe collaborations featured in *RPWP* are another highlight. Seeing RM interact with other artists, exchanging ideas and building something extraordinary, is a joy to watch. It\'s a reminder of how art thrives on connection and mutual respect. Every collaboration feels organic and adds a unique dimension to the album.\n\nWatching *""RPWP""* was an emotional rollercoaster in the best way possible. It made me reflect, laugh, and even shed a few tears.

It\'s a celebration of creativity, humanity, and the universal experiences that bind us all.\n\nIn the end, *RPWP* isn\'t just an album or a documentary-it\'s a testament to the power of music to heal, connect, and inspire.

You\'ve created something timeless, and I feel so grateful to have experienced it.', ""This documentary is nothing short of a masterpiece, blending art, music, & emotion into a captivating journey.

If you're a fan of music, art, or just raw, unfiltered creativity, this is a must-watch. 😍 🔥"", 'Namjoon is an embodiment of Love. No matter what he releases he would always promote self love. In his whole album, he described his journey of finally loving himself. He came to point of self love where he is in unbothered by people\'s remarks about himself. The song ""Lost"" is perfect discription of how sometimes we all humans feel during any stage of our life. In this song, he describes the fact that he is indeed lost, not knowing what type of person he is. But progressing towards other songs in his album, he slowly slowly accepts the fact that no matter what he is satisfied and happy with himself. Listening to this album, I feel humane and seen. He is so good at describing his feelings and emotions. Namjoon truly posseses interpersonal intelligence. He loves himself in a way that urges me to love myself too.', 'Kim Namjoon is not just an amazing artist, but also a great musician and a wonderful person. Throughout the entire film, I was overcome by various emotions from sadness, joy to all-consuming love for this man.\n\nIt was amazing to experience the side of Namjoon when he is an ordinary 29 year old guy from South Korea, and not just the side when he is a world star, the leader of the group BTS. He is very real, humane with his earthly experiences, and to the same extent he is truly a worthy wonderful artist.\n\nThe team that Namjoon has gathered around him is simply amazing, creative and talented people, each in their own field.

The Lion King is without doubt amongst the best animated films of all time and with Disneys attempts at creating original works in recent years flopping, here's another Lion King film that no one asked for.\n\nPumbaa, Timon and Rafiki are tasked with looking after the son of Simba and Nala, a young cub named Kiara. They tell the young cub the origin story of her Grandfather Mufasa in order to keep her occupied. This story plays out on screen and intermittently cuts back to the present day.\n\nHaving a present day aspect with the whole of the main narrative taking place in the past only serves to pad out the run time which isn't really needed considering it's a two hour film. They could have cut those parts, got us straight into the action and been around the 90 minute mark which is always a good aim when your target audience is children/families. That being said however I understand how that would've meant that we loose Timon and Pumbaa in the process. Whilst I appreciated them being in the film for nostalgias sake they didn't add anything to the narrative. The film used them as a kind of post modern comic relief in between the action which to be honest wasn't needed.\n\nThe thing that's given the original Lion King film its legacy is how iconic the songs are. This is something no film in the franchise has been able to replicate and this one is no different. My foot was taping along to some of the tracks but ultimately it's not a soundtrack I'm ever going to revisit and plays a big part in the fact that I'm unlikely to ever watch this film again either.\n\nThere are a couple of saving graces however. The visuals for one are exceptional, it's almost like watching a David Attenborough documentary at times. I felt like I could almost step out of the auditorium and into the pride lands.\n\nThe narrative also showed some promise towards the beginning. I was genuinely interested for a minute into how Mufasa and Taka's relationship was going to pan out. Then it turned into a road movie where they picked up other Lion King characters on the way and their relationship took a back seat however. The two lead characters inevitably end up conflicting but the reason behind the conflict was about as obvious as it gets. I won't spoil it but what do you think is most likely to cause a fight between two male friends?\n\nYep, you got it.\n\nOverall there's just better films to take your young ones/family to see at the cinema at the moment. If you're a die hard Lion King fan or are just curious for whatever reason, perhaps wait till it releases on Disney Plus."", ""Visuals are great, but it can't hold up an overall subpar movie. Fine for kids and families but leaves originality at the door.\n\nIt does fit together some fine lore to bring us up to speed with what we know from the original movie. How it does it is rehash story elements, themes and plenty of conveniences to forcibly make the pieces fit into the original. It has similar flaire to Solo where it's just fine and uninterestingly shows or tells us where things come from in this fanfiction. Sometimes it's best to leave things a mystery if the progenitor is unceremoniously bland.\n\nThe music is fine but doesn't have the same force of fun or majesty as the original score. They're kind of just there like Moana 2's music. Not bad, but certainly not memorable.\n\nThe 3D glasses also did nothing. It felt like just a regular movie instead of them trying to do anything with with 3D.\n\nThe worst part IMO was no James Earl Jones in the actual movie. I know he's sadly passed, but they've brought back voices from other people before. If they didn't want to synthesize, they could've used unused clips or even just reused a voice clip from previous Lion King works. I can't get behind a movie called Mufasa without Mufasa's actual iconic voice somewhere in the movie.\n\nFeels like a made for TV movie, and probably worth a watch on Disney+. But not really one I'd recommend for theatres or purchase."", ""With the imminent disaster that is Snow White, waiting in the wings, the company needed a big hit.\n\nI have no doubts that fans of The Lion King's many forms will flock to see it, and for kids and families, there is a definite appeal, I watched this movie about a week ago, and almost forgot to review it, that's the problem, it simply isn't memorable.\n\nYou get the impression that they played it super safe, it's just a little bland at times, it's hardly a film that'll be remembered as a classic. Sure it's a good story, but sometimes it just feels a little shoved together.\n\nAmazing visuals, lovely music, you can't fault the production values of it at all.\n\nIt's a shame that James Earl Jones couldn't have been persuaded to at least feature, but it was nice that the film was dedicated to him.\n\nA nice movie, just hardly memorable.\n\n6/10."", ""The score always delivers emotionally. What I noticed is that Disney is losing, with the latest products, that double layer, the message under the surface that only adults can decipher. Maybe it's because of the story and the circumstances, but I found it too exclusive for children, especially from a director like Jenkins.\n\nEverything else is okay. Nothing big, nothing great. You get what you go in for, emotion, fun, something that could make you feel again the feelings that you felt the first time you watched the original thing. I don't know if they're going to expand the cinematic universe.\n\nItalian dubbing sucked. Singers can't dub. Period."", 'Pleasantly surprised. It wasn\'t the soulless cash grab people claimed-the movie has heart and plenty of story.\n\nPeople love to hate on things and they will make this movie a target. This is why I feel obliged to tell you it\'s not that bad. If you like this type of movies, blockbusters, you will probably enjoy it; I know I did.\n\nI feel like the CGI was on par with the first but they\'ve definitely improved the expression of the animals (one of the biggest complaints from the first one).\n\nOne of the most obvious mistakes is that the movie should have been longer; the story feels cramped, and you can feel it on the pacing.\n\n""less childhood trauma, more meerkat"" is what I want for the threequel.', ""As a huge fan of The Lion King, I can honestly say this movie is excellent. The cinematography and music, especially in 3D IMAX are absolutely stunning. There wasn't a single boring moment and the visuals are breathtaking, you can read the animals' emotions much more clearly compared to the first live action film, the pacing is smooth and the plot holds up well. While I occasionally struggled to distinguish some lion characters, the voices made it easy to follow. A bit more humor would've been nice though but overall, it's a well crafted prequel that delves into Scar's origin beautifully. People seem too critical these days instead of just enjoying things."", ""I have watched this movie with my kids and they have enjoyed it well , it got simple narration to explain about the life of mufasa , story begins when mufasa lost in floods and swept away from his parents , later found by a same age lion called taka , taka takes him to stay with his parents and then what happens in their life's is the story about, the story is simple and enjoyable to kids , as a main lead mufasa was missing his parents but taka mother and taka both give them good support , finally whether mufasa able to meet his parents and who he meets during this journey is all the movie story is, movie got good vfx and emotional story too but the director has taken too much cinematic liberty where you can realise that all the characters are exactly behaving like real human beings but overall it's ok because you will forget about i one suprise character which I like is about taka? Who is taka going to become I am not going to reveal, so overall i would like to give 7/10 as it's a clean watchable movie with family and kids."", ""I really like this movie a lot annd the music is great as well!

This was a great role for Blue Ivy Carter! Her voice was so natural she is destined to be a star!\n\nThe music is great too I was dancing and bopping my head a lot to this new and original movie! The storyline is good and I really love seeing this origin story of Mufasa and Scar!"", ""Mufasa: The Lion King is so much better than the soulless remake it has to act as a prequel to. All of the biggest issues have been rectified instantly and it has a greater purpose by telling a new story, even with some classic prequel issues. Everything set after the events of the first film could've been easily cut out to let the main story breathe however they are thankfully brief whenever they do interrupt and it comes to a nice conclusion.\n\nAaron Pierre makes the role of Mufasa his own with a strong performance that has him feeling reluctant to accept his destiny and becoming more stoic as it goes along. Similarly, Kelvin Harrison Jr. Gets more deceitful throughout and chooses to make his voice work sound closer to Jeremy Irons than Chiwetel Ejiofor. The only occasionally distracting element is some of the line readings sounding rushed.\n\nDirector Barry Jenkins is massively over qualified for this and held back by the photo real animation that comes with this but his direction is still more ambitious and exciting than Jon Favreau's was. He isn't afraid to sacrifice a pointless commitment to realism to create a beautiful looking film where the locations are more varied, the visuals are more creative and the cinematography is infinitely more dynamic.\n\nThe CGI is always faultless and thankfully all the lions now show a much wider range of emotions, enhanced by the massive increase in close ups. The songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda are definitely some of his weakest, they're very repetitive without his usual level of catchiness and it's a testament to how strong everything else is that this isn't a major issue. Dave Metzger's score only stands out when referencing Hans Zimmer's work, which it does constantly."", ""Mufasa: The Lion King was gorgeous to look at and does well in telling the story of Mufasa and Taka, but it falls a bit short with the original songs and the seemingly forced inclusion of Timon and Pumbaa. It's a prequel that is part sequel, allowing us to see where Simba and company are at after the first film, but it takes us back one too many times detracting from Mufafa's journey.\n\nIn the end, Mufasa: The Lion King is a solid follow-up that kids will enjoy with a story that was allowed a bit more room to breathe from their original remake letting it stand above.\n\nBrad: 8 Josh: 7 Final: 7.5."", ""I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this one. As a prequel that tells the rise of Mufasa, Simba's father, it is very formulaic and predictable. But it is also beautifully animated, quite funny, and emotionally well-balanced between adventure, drama, humour, and tragedy. For a prequel, it plays it sometimes too safe, but that is fine to me since the audience knows the conclusion of the story. The upside of playing it safe is that the movie thankfully avoids any major distractions or side characters that could have taken away from the meat of the film. My only major gripes are that the soundtrack is forgettable compared to the Elton John classics, and some of the plot development proceeds too quickly at numerous points in the story, which takes away from its intended emotional impact.\n\nNonetheless, let me repeat that I am surprised by how much I liked this film. I could not be bothered by the previous CGI adaptation at all. But as far as big studio prequels are concerned, this is one of the better ones. Sure, they clearly made the film for easy money, but miraculously it respects the Lion King fanbase and oozes love for the source material. Graphically, it is well-composed and it manages to find good use for CGI that gets close to the beauty of the original animation. And although it adds little to the story, it provides enough new context and meat to make the original story shine even brighter. Nothing can beat the 1995 original masterpiece, and this one obviously pales in comparison, but I am glad that they are treating the franchise with respect."", '""Mufasa: The Lion King"" a film that serves as a prequel and sequel to ""The Lion King"" (2019), the script focuses mainly on being a prequel telling the life of Mufasa and his allies, including the origin of Scar, the story manages to have effective moments and others somewhat weak on screen, but the story is solid although not very original. The computer animation achieves an almost realistic cinematography in most of the scenes, both in the landscapes and in the characters, much fauna looks realistic. Also being a drama film, it is obviously also a musical following the tradition of ""The Lion King"", the songs composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda range from good to average, being the attractive point for this production since its promotion. ""Mufasa: The Lion King"" is a solid film with a story that manages to entertain despite being unoriginal.', 'This film definitely exceeded my expectations despite them being high enough to begin with. The animation in this film looked amazing, the score and soundtrack were both incredible and the action was superb.\n\nThe entire cast of this film was great, but Aaron Pierre and Mads Mikkelsen both stole the show for me as Mufasa and Kiros. Seeing Aaron Pierre in more films is so great as he is such an amazing actor, he played Mufasa so well. Also seeing Mads Mikkelsen back playing a villain was amazing. He really does have the perfect voice for a villain, which is why he gave us one of the best Bond villains ever in Casino Royale.\n\nThe ending of this film definitely made me tear up because of everything that Mufasa goes through, everything that Taka/Scar goes through and the fact I know what happens in their future after them being such great friends and brothers.\n\nOverall, this was a great film and a very enjoyable watch. I would definitely recommend going to see this film and seeing it on the biggest screen possible.\n\n""The circle is broken. There will be one lion king.""', ""Lovely story that can be shortened in 45m movie. Goosebumps and a lovely movie, loved it but expected a better story , a stronger one that can be remembered.\n\nBut you have to watch the movie , it's a must for lion king die hard fans.\n\nLittle kids didn't enjoy it at all and it was difficult for them to understand the story.\n\nThe music was awful , didn't make sense at all, it was weak , did not expect that from disney and from a movie that won the oscars in the original one.\n\nGood try but please don't ruin it anymore.\n\nIt seems they will.\n\nAnyway the animation was great , felt real and got me into the story."", ""The Lion King (1994) is my favorite Disney Animated movie of all time and it has a special place in my heart. With that being said, I wasn't a fan of the 2019 live-action remake as it was basically the same movie with a couple of changes and the changes they made didn't sit well with me. So when I heard that Disney was going to make a prequel to the 2019 movie, I knew it was going to be bad especially after watching the trailer. Well I just finished watching the movie and I was proven right cause this movie was trash.\n\nPositives for Mufasa: The Lion King (2024): The opening scene where the movie starts off with a remembrance of James Earl Jones had me a little choked up because the original animated movie from 1994 was my introduction to James Earl Jones. Barry Jenkins does the best he can with his direction. The musical score and songs from Dave Metzger, Nicholas Britell and Lin-Manuel Miranda was amazing. The voice performances were great, particularly Kelvin Harrison Jr. As Taka, John Kani as Rafiki, Kagiso Lediga as young Rafiki, Mads Mikkelsen as Kiros and especially Aaron Pierre as Mufasa. Between this and Rebel Ridge (2024), this guy has a bright future ahead of him and I look forward to seeing him as John Stewart in the Lantern series on HBO.\n\nNegatives for Mufasa: The Lion King (2024): This is a movie that did not need to exist because no one wanted to know the origin story of Mufasa and his rise to becoming king. I also don't see a movie where I'm supposed to sympathize with Scar or Taka since that was his name. Even with that, the movie clearly establishes in the beginning that Scar not becoming king is his fault and had he just listen to one character, then he would be king. The main villains of these white lions being led by Hannibal Lecter were underwhelming and it begs the question why they even cast Mads Mikkelsen as the lead white lion. The movie also has Keith David, aka Goliath from Gargoyles and Childs from John Carpenter's The Thing, as Mufasa's biological father and he literally does nothing here, so why did they cast him in this movie. The visuals in this movie are ugly to look at and there is no life to them. And finally, this movie does the thing that I can't stand with a lot of prequels which is they are answering questions I never asked and providing me with answers that I didn't like or find satisfying.\n\nOverall, Mufasa: The Lion King (2024) is another awful live-action movie from Disney that only exists to serve as a cash grabs and that is sad."", ""As someone who has grown up loving the Lion King, I was surprised there was a need for this story to be told, and the trailer had me even further unsure, but of course I went to watch it anyway, more out of curiosity than expecting something incredible.\n\nHowever, now I've seen it I felt it did add to the original story. Was it as good as the original? No but don't expect it to be & you'll enjoy it.\n\nThe visuals and soundtrack were great though and although elements of the story felt a little rushed at times to cram in certain elements, on the whole it was enjoyable & I still felt emotional in places with some subtle (& not so subtle) nods to the original.\n\nOverall, solid film, would watch again in future."", ""It's watchable but the music and songs are annoying. Similar to the joker filled with songs that are unnecessary.\n\nSomehow i wasn't afraid of the villain. His white color was noticeable but he did nothing to make you afraid of. The producers avoided scenes when he killed other lions probably because of age restrictions.\n\nThe hilarious characters aren't like in original version.\n\nThe only positive thing about it is the development in the storyline between scar & mufass\n\nYou can enjoy the movie if you didn't compare it with the original Simba. It's watchable, but don't have high expectations, even if the trailer gave you some."", 'The problem with new ""Lion King"" movies is that the more realistic the animated cats get, the less we fall for the illusion. In that regard ""Mufasa"" is not an exception. In this prequel the destination is more important than the journey, yet it\'s the journey what we are forced to watch. We already know the narrative and it\'s like seeing a random painter trying to correct a Picasso to make it more political, more virtue signaling according with the times we live in, resulting in pure mediocrity. The script has to be a certain way, the misguided aesthetic is already decided and the editing is strictly controlled. What\'s the point of getting an Oscar-winning director behind projects like ""Moonlight"" and ""The Underground Railroad if the goal of the movie is to show very realistic cats? All the benefits of animated movies have been taken away and nothing has been added to fill the void.\n\nMufasa is the prequel that follows the ""Lion King"" younger days. Everything is played out as flashbacks, which is too abstract for the little ones to understand. The whole movie describes the same journey we already seen more than once in one of the latest prequels. The script absolutely refuses to surprise or complicate the drama. Instead of that screenwriter Jeff Nathanson made sure to answer questions no one asked. Questions like the film itself, completely irrelevant that only remind us of the original movie.\n\nAs a younger version of himself ""Mufasa"" is perfect in every way and doesn\'t dare to challenge his adult version. The script treats him like God. He has nothing to learn and therefore nowhere to go. The only thing ""Mufasa: The Lion King"" really succeeds in doing is proving that photorealistic lions can\'t lead Shakespeare-inspired plays. It\'s a film that has lost the advantages of animation and live-action. But this is not the director fault. The whole project was already a mistake before he got onboard. It doesn\'t matter if the world\'s most praised filmmakers and singers got onboard this ship if there is no wind or engine to push it forward and it sinks like a stone.', 'The highest praise for the visual spectacle that it is! I\'m beyond impressed. As for the script.. I\'m somewhat disappointed, considering my low expectations.\n\nTwo issues : First, this version of Timon and Pumba continue to be more of an annoyance than anything else (I could do without ever hearing seth rogen again) and their continued appearance could have been completely trimmed to make this shorter than the 2 hours it is (though it doesn\'t feel as long)! Unnecessarily segmenting the story for no reason. Second, it feels like a snow-ball rolling down the mountain.. picking up ""things I know"" from the original Lion King as it goes. There\'s too much foreshadowing and predictability for any fan of the original, and absolutely nothing is left to the imagination. Not to mention the disgusting amount of references.. I joked that the mountain would even split and form on screen, and my jaw dropped when it did! It\'s almost like watching the original mixed in a blender.\n\nBut the movie is entertaining for children and there\'s not that much ""violence"" on screen (kept away from the cameras).\n\nThe songs are acceptable and I won\'t remember any tomorrow..', 'Went in with a healthy amount of skepticism. Loved the original Lion King as well as the remake. I really enjoyed this movie. They took what fell short with the remake and improved upon it in this film. For example the Lions have a bit more facial expression. The narrative was compelling and and easy to get wrapped up into. The music hit perfectly with amazing instrumentals and heart tugging songs, and the animation had a lot more ""life"" to it, with beatiful environments through out rather then staying in one location the whole movie. The voice actors were amazing and super talented! Absolutely would recommend giving it a watch in theaters!!!', 'Tone, Script & Story: The story is prequel to Simmba released in 2018. It\'s the story of Simmba\'s father ""Mufasa"". Here we come to know even he was lost. The story is how he returns to the glorious land of Milele.\n\nI don\'t have much to say, just some worries. Lions are dangerous. A movie like this should not make today\'s children think Lions could be Friendly. It\'s the only concern I have since I watched the movies. Note Lion befriends none. A male lion would even kill the offspring\'s which are not his.\n\nKeeping the concern aside, it\'s a good watch.\n\nTimon and Pumba were great. I wish if they were more. The screen presence of Rafiki and Nala was awesome.\n\nDirection, Screenplay, Cinematography: Just look how grown the technology has been. Commendable Animation. Grass lands, terrain, mountains, snow, river, all the animals, etc everything is spectacular.\n\nMusic: I watched the Hindi dubbed version. There the music was justified and went well the movie.\n\nFinal Verdict: These are the movies meant for entire family. Do watch it on big screen.', ""LIKES: The Animation The Voice Acting The Story Has Heart Comedic Interludes Are Fun At times The Dialogue At Times The Music Summary: The animation is the crown jewel of this movie and, again, a fine display of the power of CGI in Disney's hands. An amazingly realistic design of the animals is a treat to the eyes, loaded with smooth movement, powerful steps, and speed that I've seen in the documentaries. All the animals hold this detail and seldom lose that realism during their antics. A few added facial features add some personality to the mix, especially during the kid and comedy interludes, which were very welcome to add a little more of that 90s magic I fell in love with long ago. The mixture has crafted better characters that are no longer bound by the narrative so many hold dear. Outside of the visual work, Mufasa's tale also has beautiful sound editing to make the world come to life and the worth of the theater. From the roars of the proud lions to the thundering stomps of the elephants, it all holds the majestic prowess of the African Savannah and raises my goosebumps at the technical prowess. Even more impressive is the musical score that is filled with the spirit I wish was in Moana 2. Lin Manuel-Miranda achieves magic again with many of the tracks, injecting his pizazz and cleverness into live-action numbers that feel energetic, like the animated Disney world. Awesome beats, powerful coordination, and deeper lyrics bring the Disney Renaissance back to people like me and still manage to convey the thoughts of the characters in talented ways.\n\nPast the technical moments, the movie does well at making a fun adventure for the family to watch. The story is familiar but now bent on the rise of the future king and his journey to Pride Rock. Geeks like me will enjoy the references made in the movies and start connecting the pieces to what our characters would wield as their trademark tools. Seeing some of the references make their appearance was fun, and I appreciated the creativity and ambiance that came with them, while others may have been a bit more of a stretch for the melodramatic lovers. Well-written dialogue is present in this movie as well, a combination of the shaman wisdom of the narrator, the British drama elements with an African twist, and also that fun family banter to soften it up. What's great for me is that it holds so much emotion to it, loaded with personality and tension that is performed beautifully by the cast at hand. Mufasa's words are delivered with precision that balances confidence and coming-of-age fears of a developing king in the making. Taka's voice holds a good spectrum as well, mirroring the journey to becoming the nefarious villain of The Lion King, great use of emotion that makes you feel so much for what was just a typical Disney villain in the previous iteration. Sarabi's words are beautiful and powerful at the same time. A strong character that also has many layers, her purpose was much stronger than I thought and yet still needed some more time to develop. Boone accomplishes much with what she does, though, and I loved the poise she injected into her tone. And the comedic interludes by our favorite odd couple, Timon and Pumbaa, are just as quirky as ever, fun, kiddy, and perfect for making the kids in my showing laugh in delight.\n\nThe result of all these components is a film that has a lot of heart, soul, and emotional depth that I love in my movies. All the great visuals deliver that powerful punch as the scenes come together, taking all the build-up of the voice acting and music and making it sing. Match that with fleshed-out characters and a story that holds a lot of the original movie's moxie, and you have accomplished a wonderous spectacle that should capture a lot of the younger generation's fascination and awe.\n\nDISLIKES: The Plot Is Rushed The Story Is Predictable The Moments Get A Tad Cheesy The Fighting Is Dialed Down The Comedy Gets A Tad Too Much Still Doesn't Quite Have The Emotional Punch For Much Of The Movie More James Earl Jones Needed: Summary: In regards to my dislikes, the plot still needs some time and pizazz to have the caliber I think they were aiming to achieve. It's predictable and a bit too reliant on The Lion King to be original like they were doing. This tale could have thrived, but the time limitations get in the way and speed through too many things to get a grasp of most of the characters. That special connection, the development of the motifs, and the true impasses are eroded down to a mediocre level that still can't rival what the cartoon did so well. Maybe it's because they are trying to modernize the tale to not be so traumatic to the younger generation. Maybe it's because of the comedic interludes. Either way, the story still needed some more development to be the memorable origin story they wanted.\n\nSpeaking of the comedic interlude, Mufasa has sort of a Lion King 1.5 tone to it. It's funny to have the story's darker elements lightened by the comedic relief they provide. I laughed a lot at the self-badgering it gave to the movie and some of the corny jokes that this iteration delivers well. I enjoyed the reactions of Rafiki even more as his patience was tested by their obsessions to be in the story. Yet, the comedy did get a tad overbearing and happened enough to take a significant chunk of the movie that could have been used for optimizing other elements of the film. One thing is the action of the movie. Here is where the realism hurts the film because they have to portray the animal fights as close to realistic as possible. To maintain the rating, they can't turn it into a bloodbath of mauling slashes and piercing bites. What they did walks that tightrope well, but the result is a lot more talking than fighting (like some anime fights), meaning I was bored out of my mind for the epic climactic fights that the animation still does better. In addition, some of those speeches are kind of corny, diving a little too much into the Disney New Age to feel natural. They are relatively short-lived as a benefit, but I wanted more to these moments for an exciting climax. This again shows that the movie didn't quite capture the magic of the first animated film, nor did I give me enough James Earl Jones for a final send-off of the late actor.\n\nThe VERDICT: Mufasa was an improvement for me compared to the live-action version of The Lion King. The visuals are, of course, more polished and better tweaked, the sound is gorgeous and realistic, and together are a powerhouse worthy of the theater (perhaps even in 3-D). The music is one of my favorite aspects, thanks to clever lyrics, emotional undertones, and powerful performances that feel like a Disney movie. And crafting deeper characters with matching story elements and great voice acting to deliver the roles, including the comedic balance to cut through the sadder story. However, the movie still has work to do to bring everything I think they were trying for with this film. The story is still too familiar and reliant on the original material and needs more time to give everyone the elements they need to shine. I still want that enchanting attitude the original had, the fights that they made using those anthropomorphic qualities rather than toned-down fights to not terrify our kids. I want to bake some more of that adult humor into the film and rely less on forced interludes that are cutesy. And I still hope for a story that holds the same majesty that they got so right long ago. Balancing all this together, Mufasa is worth a visit for the technical prowess and musical scores, but you might get the most bang for your buck if you hit this one at home.\n\nMy Scores are: Adventure/Animation/Drama/Family/Musical /Fantasy: 7-7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5."", 'Mufasa\'s character is explored with nuance, showcasing his strengths and vulnerabilities. The film introduces us to new characters that enrich the story, each adding layers to Mufasa\'s life and the challenges he encounters. The interactions between Mufasa and his family are particularly touching, emphasizing the importance of love and support in leadership.\n\n""Mufasa: The Lion King"" is a triumph that pays homage to the classic while standing strong on its own. It captures the essence of what made the original film so beloved while providing fresh insights into its characters. This film is not just for children; it speaks to audiences of all ages, reminding us of the values of courage, love, and the enduring power of family. Don\'t miss the chance to experience this captivating tale-it\'s a journey worth taking!', ""Mufasa (2024) is a movie my wife and I watched in theaters this evening. The storyline explores Mufasa's journey as he strives to reach the land of Milele. When a flood separates him from his family, Mufasa is taken in by another pride of lions. However, his survival is threatened by a group of white lions intent on ruling everything, forcing Mufasa to forge new bonds to overcome the challenges and find Milele.\n\nDirected by Barry Jenkins (Moonlight), the film features an impressive voice cast, including Aaron Pierre (Rebel Ridge), Mads Mikkelsen (Pusher), Keith David (The Thing), Danny Glover (ATL), Blue Ivy Carter (Black Is King), Thandiwe Newton (Crash), Kelvin Harrison Jr. (Chevalier), and Tiffany Boone (Hunters).\n\nThere's a lot to enjoy in this film, though it's not without its flaws. The animation is outstanding and tailored for an immersive 3D experience. The storyline exceeded my expectations with its strong characters, compelling villains, and excellent voice performances. Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner shine again as Pumbaa and Timon, providing much-needed humor. The love story, brotherhood subplot, and Mufasa's depiction as a leader were particularly well done. While the ending conflict fell short, the ultimate conclusion felt satisfying.\n\nIn conclusion, Mufasa may not be a masterpiece, but it's an enjoyable and visually stunning adventure. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend giving it a watch."", ""Solid movie...with some good songs and some not of course it doesn't compare with the originals but it is a nice story to follow...some parts of the movie feel a little bit rushed but I can understand that the movie is made for younger viewers so I think they enjoyed...now for older fans it was okay I would totally recommend it to all lion king fans...also the visuals and cgi was great really showing the emotions of the lions...it is not a boring movie it is a story of mufasa and taka going from point A to point B meeting the original characters in the way...So as I said in the beginning it is a solid movie good work from disney and I am exited to see where is this story going."", ""I am not quite sure how some find Sonic 3 better than Mufasa The Lion King. I saw both films and while Sonic felt like a happy meal Mufasa felt like a complete meal. I have to admit Mufasa's trailer's didn't create a ton of excitement for myself. After seeing the movie I feel it was a worthy legacy prequel. The fleshing out of Mufasa's backstory actually worked fairly well for the most part.\n\nI had initial doubts with the plot but overall it was nice getting a semi fresh story that felt original enough. Visuals were a huge upgrade over The Lion King. The animals eye's had more semblance of souls then the prior entry into the franchise.\n\nThe music though does not come close to the original animated films sound track but thats ok. The story and visuals and characters were strong enough and people clapped at the end of my showing.\n\nOverall 8/10. Visually stunning movie."", 'Honest Review:\n\nThe Good Stuff: 1. The CGI is absolutely next level! After the first 10 minutes, you completely forget that none of it is real. Every character is detailed to perfection.\n\n2. I watched the Hindi version because of SRK, his sons, and other Indian artists who lent their voices. Honestly, the Hindi dubbing and dialogues are super well-written. The conversations between Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious! Special shoutout to Makrand Deshpande as Rafiki-his voice made the character feel so alive. Perfect casting for Rafiki!\n\n3. Rafiki-what a mysterious and powerful character! This movie delves into his backstory-where he came from, how he became part of the Lion family, and why everyone respects him so much.\n\n4. The new villain, Kiros. OMG, this character is terrifying, powerful, and adds a whole new level of intensity to the story.\n\nThe Not-So-Good Stuff: 1. The story itself is a letdown. The first 30 minutes are solid-you\'re hooked as you meet Mufasa, his parents, Taka, and Kiros. But once the chase sequences begin, it starts getting dull. The story feels stuck, and you eventually lose interest. Even though the climax has some great action scenes, it feels weak, and you can\'t help but wonder, ""When will this end?"" 2. Too many songs! Yes, it\'s Disney, and yes, it\'s for kids, but the songs keep interrupting the flow. Just as you get invested in the story, another song pops up. While the songs are meaningful and reflect the characters\' emotions, it\'s too much. The worst moment? Kiros-the scariest, most dangerous character-starts singing in a very serious situation. It completely ruined his vibe. Right before the song, he\'s intimidating, but by the end of it, he loses all his menace.\n\nFinal Words: If you\'re a Lion King fan, it\'s worth watching, especially for kids. The visuals and characters are impressive, but don\'t expect a strong story.\n\nPro Tip: Bring snacks! The middle part might drag, and snacks will help you survive it. 😄', ""Horrible storyline and dialogues. Person who wrote the comedy scripts really sucks. Too many songs that doesnt sound good & stick to storyline. Being a hard core lion king fan, this movie makes me so angry. My kids slept during the movie & i'm writing this review while watching. People started talking to each other during the movie. Really surprised to how dreamworks decided to proceed with this storyline & dialogues.\n\nWhen dreamworks can make movies like how to train a dragon ? Dont they know how to indulge people from the beginning. You always need to impress the audience in the first 10 mins of the movies. This one gave the vibe how the movie will be in the first 10 mins, that i made a mistake."", 'Unbelievably Stunning visuals and colors unlike any movies in recent years that I can remember. But the music is just incredible and on another level. Chills throughout the movie, just insanely good. The storytelling and intense chase scenes, the villians, the thrills of the story and the audio is amazing and one the best Ive ever seen. I Love the music in this film, it is a Must See in the movie theater and I would like to see this movie again and again in the future.\n\nGorgeous colors and animation. The animals in this movie are incredibly realistic and visually perfect. The dangerous animals like crocs and lions and scary interplay of music colors and visuals is on another level. I LOVE this film!!!!! 10/10 across the board in my opinion.', ""Overall the film was great and a nice added backstory for Mufasa. Timon and Pumba made the movie much better. The visuals didnt feel as good as the previous film, eventho still looked really good. Sometimes too much added exoressions on the lions faces, which made them look unreal and took you out of the movie. Especially when the LIONS sang, they moved their mouths and it looked really stupid. Also the songs were dumbest songs I have heard in a long time. Like from a kids cartoon. Also when they sang, the story didnt move until they finished the song. Scar should have had more dept, to why he betrays Mufasa. Side note, the snow looked fake as F... eventho everything else looked pretty really. Also Scar should have been a bit darker, like he is in lion king. Many times I got confused if something happening to Scar or Mufasa, because they looked really similar. The Go-Pro style shots were awesome and made really well. Also a lot of great humor, especially from Timon & Pumba. I hope they make more of these, but let Jon Favreu direct it again, since he's much better at it."", ""When I first heard that there was going to be ANOTHER Disney live action remake, I had no intention to see it. However, my friend had different intentions and I was dragged to see it. And wow, it was a waste of time and money. The film is unfunny, dragged out and pretentious. The lion king series has been dragged out to the point where the dialogue and story was extremely predictable. The characters were very unlikable, so much so to the point that I wish they were all killed off at the end. The film is an intent to be a origin story for Mufasa, but it's so forgettable that it shouldn't be deemed cannon. Disney needs to stop rehashing old IP and make a film that feels like classic Disney; charming, fun, and original, compared to new Disney; old, unoriginal, bland, and rancid. Don't waste your money or time on this needless cash grab, it is rancid."", ""Lost and alone, orphaned cub Mufasa meets a sympathetic lion named Taka, the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destinies.\n\nUnlike many who thought this story didn't need to be told, I was excited to learn more about it. In this regard, it didn't disappoint. It added to the original story, but it wasn't better or even close to it. The visuals were great, and I liked that you could clearly tell the different lions and their species apart. The soundtrack was amazing. I enjoyed most of the songs, and they stuck in my mind for hours after the movie ended. Lin-Manuel Miranda just doesn't miss!\n\nMy biggest problem with this movie was the pacing. It was slow and boring at times. I found myself checking the time often during the nearly 2-hour runtime. At the same time, many scenes, especially at the end, felt rushed and should've been more in-depth.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty good family movie to watch with low expectations.\n\nScore:7/10."", ""As a huge fan of the original animated Lion King, Mufasa: The Lion King left me disappointed. It was a fine film, enjoyable for families, and had some stellar visuals, but I never felt any of it. One of the things I love the most about the original film, and even the 2019 remake to some extent, was the powerful emotion and resonant songs. There was none of that here, and frankly considering the talent involved I expected way better.\n\nThe film is technically impressive, as there is no denying how well-animated each animal is as well as the scenery, and the attention to detail shines through. This outing has more life than the 2019 remake, even if it struggles to keep you invested in its original story. Barry Jenkins attempts to deliver captivating character moments, but you feel at arm's length throughout most of its run-time, and the pacing is all over the place. Mufasa is a step up from 2019's The Lion King but a step down for Barry Jenkins. Mufasa is a bizarre, disassociating experience; what happens when one of the most visually expressive directors alive works with anti-emotive film tech, with Jenkins' cinematic portraiture aimed at feline faces that still can't show a real feeling.\n\nI can understand why Barry Jenkins was drawn to this story on paper (Mufasa and Scar origin story amidst faction in-fighting). Unfortunately, the same passion he's displayed in his previous works just doesn't come through here. Mufasa: The Lion King feels torn between Jenkins' desire to slow down and let impactful moments breathe versus the constant interruptions from Timon and Pumbaa, rushed pacing, or the need to push forward to the next song, unfunny gag, or scene designed to keep the kids engaged and the merchandise selling. Even the songs don't quite hit as hard as you hope despite being written by the great Lin-Manuel Miranda, although a few of them are catchy enough.\n\nAt this point, the only good that can come out of this is whatever project Jenkins decides to do next with the paycheck he collected and hopefully (likely) this will just be considered an unfortunate but fascinating blip on an otherwise rewarding career. This film is far less frustrating than its predecessor, but it never fully lands.\n\nIt is an entertaining watch but lacks the substance and emotion of what made the original animated film so special. I hoped Barry Jenkins and Lin-Manuel Miranda could recapture the spark, but unfortunately, I was left disappointed. But hey, it's better than the 2019 film (and I liked that one to some extent)! It's enjoyable, just not memorable."", ""Mufasa: The Lion King is a visually stunning prequel that explores the origin story of one of Disney's most iconic characters. Set against the backdrop of breathtaking African landscapes, the film delivers a feast for the eyes with its vibrant animation and detailed visuals. I really liked how it balances nostalgia with new perspectives, offering heartfelt moments and emotional depth. The story dives into themes of courage, family, and legacy, making it both inspiring and memorable. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to the tale, this movie is a powerful addition to The Lion King saga. Must see."", ""This film is completely passable. There's some very good looking visual effects and the directing from Barry Jenkins makes this movie entertaining enough with some fun sequences and gorgeous shots. The film also does a pretty solid job at building up the characterization for Mufasa. However the movie is very predictable and ultimately forgettable. The way this movie is formatted as 3/4 prequel and 1/4 sequel to the 2019 Lion King really hurts the pacing of the movie. Whenever we're invested in the Mufasa story it cuts to Timon and Pumba making some painfully unfunny jokes. Scar's motivations for not liking Mufasa are kind of lame and really undermine a great villain. The musical numbers are also very bad. Not a single one of these new tunes is catchy and they all kind of drag on. This is a big problem because the original Lion King has some of the best musical numbers in film. Overall Mufasa is fine. It's not dreadful to get through at all and there are some interesting themes brought up. But it's not one I would ever rewatch. 6/10."", 'I like it: it\'s childish but compelling enough, it\'s virtually CGIed but appealing in style, and it\'s not the most ambitious storytelling but complete in itself. I mean, you just can\'t go wrong with the classic Disney coming-of-age, self-discovering, returning-home, making-a-team formula. Visual effects also improved compared to The Lion King remake, with more facially expressive animals, fairytalish sceneries, and impressive wide-panels during action sequences. Seeing young Taka\'s genuine joy and frisky cubhood with his brother is truly delightful until the dramatic irony of their future rivalry cuts deep, which fits perfectly with the film\'s motif of ""destiny."" However lazy the writing may have been with their mutual love for Sarabi or the stolen royalty, the finale of each character is well-rounded and connects seamlessly with the beginning of the original.\n\nYet of course I have reserves. The story is at times overly fantastical, with the characters themselves mentioning they haven\'t eaten throughout the entire film --- and obviously you can\'t show children blood and hunting. Several times natural elements also pulled me out of the narrative for being too perfect, including fully transparent ice, flash flood, and a giant under-the-mountain water cave. Disney is a lot more restrained and repetitive over the years in its moral projection, for example in the original animation we get stuff like Mufasa\'s death, Nala\'s look, and Simba\'s introspection under the stars with Hans Zimmer\'s epic ""Reflections of Mufasa"" playing. What a shame younger audiences now can\'t be inspired by creative, reality-based, life-thoughts-provoking content.\n\nOverall I\'m satisfied enough, especially toward the end when Kiara roared into the same sky Simba and Mufasa all did once, completing the circle of life that guided us for 30 years.', ""Mufasa is the prequal of the lion king the movie is good but not the story but it is good visual the visual are too good it graps attention for few times but main point or negative point is story and songs the song of this movie is not good 😐 but story good but for few time I think makers can give more time to make good story but they focus on visual of this flim I give for star to this flim because of visual and story think this the last part and actors and visual arts serving good performance but because of story and song it can't perform well I watch in english. And 3d and this my first review."", 'It was a good solid story, would give it 8-8.5 story wise. Lots of moments with the same feel as the animated original!\n\nThe new songs were so so, except one ""the new love song"". Would give the songs 6-7 all in all!\n\nThe movie shines when the original themes from the original lion king comes on.\n\nOverall the movie was very good, not great. Would score it 7-8. So I\'ll settle for 7.5. But since we can\'t give that here I give an 8.\n\nThe critics out there doing the same old ""too realistic graphics and talking lions"" nonsense can take a hike. What do you want? 3D animated lions running around just roaring. For that you can watch the real lions on nature channel so the whole point is moot! That\'s just BS.\n\nI recommend it as a feel good movie in the holiday season!\n\nA very solid one but not great one!', 'They\'ve been praying for rain for ages but are ill-prepared for when it finally comes and washes away the young ""Mufasa"" from the loving paws of his parents and out into the wilderness. Luckily, he is rescued by the friendly young cub ""Taka"" whose mother ""Eshe"" convinces his sceptical father ""Obasi"" to let her adopt him. The pair prove inseparable as they grow up, but the encroachment of a pride of angry white lions led by ""Kiros"" soon threatens their peaceful lives and forces the two to flee in search of a mystical land. Along the way they encounter the wily lioness ""Sarabi"" and her airborne early warning system ""Zazu"" and joining forces, have their work cut out for them crossing the snowy mountains. The whole story is regaled by the sagely ""Rafiki"" to a young cub ""Kiara"" and the underused, rough-round-the-edges, warthog/meerkat combo of ""Pumbaa"" and ""Timon"" so we know the ending all along. Not that jeopardy is in anyway the point here, it\'s not that kind of Disney film. It\'s really just a fairly shameless rip-off of the first, far superior, film that though it looks great with all the integrated live-action visuals has a story that\'s cheesily wafer thin. It\'s purpose is to set out the origins of the ""Lion King"" (1994) but all it really does is remind us of just how good that was and just how average this one is. They keep referring to the ""Circle of Life"" but barring a few meanderings from the orchestral score into the songs from the past, we are simply left with some banal offerings from Lin-Manuel Miranda best summed up by ""Bye Bye"" - straight from the Janet and John book of rhyming ""seas"" with ""trees"". Certainly, it looks great but it\'s also quite confusing whom it\'s for. The kids watching in the cinema with me were quickly bored by the undercooked story once the awe of the visuals had worn off. It\'s all perfectly watchable and is quite a testament to the arts of those in the CGI department well worthy of the big screen, but it\'s all instantly forgettable fayre that just sort of rolls along towards it\'s rousing denouement unremarkably.', ""Mufasa: The Lion King is directed by Barry Jenkins and has a superstar cast starring Aaron Pierre as Mufasa, Kelvin Harrison Jr. As Taka, Mads Mikkelsen as Kiros, Thandiwe Newton as Eshe, Beyoncé as Nala, and her daughter as Kiara.\n\nLet's be honest: if you've seen The Lion King (2019), you already know how Mufasa: The Lion King unfolds. This prequel attempts to explore Mufasa's origins, but the familiar beats of the franchise dominate the narrative. While some new characters and settings are introduced, the essence of the story feels overly familiar, maybe too much to my liking.\n\nAaron Pierre delivers a solid performance as young Mufasa, carrying the weight of an origin story that seeks to make the legendary lion more relatable. Kelvin Harrison Jr.'s Taka offers hints of the tension that will lead to his eventual betrayal, while Mads Mikkelsen as Kiros and Thandiwe Newton as Eshe bring a sense of gravitas to the new characters. Beyoncé reprises her role as Nala, with her daughter, Kiara, offering a sweet connection to the future generation.\n\nVisually, the film is as stunning as its predecessor, with its rich landscapes and meticulously detailed CGI. Barry Jenkins' direction gives the story moments of heart, but the emotion isn't the same intensity as with the original. It's heartwarming, yes, but lacks the raw impact of The Lion King.\n\nThis is, ultimately, a feel-good film. It has its moments of charm, but doesn't tread any groundbreaking territory. If you're hoping for a deeper dive into Mufasa's psyche or a radically different take, this isn't it.\n\nIt's a visually stunning but narratively safe prequel. It's worth a watch for devoted fans, but not an absolute must-see.

It\'s consistently jumping forward to introduce a new character or move the simple story along.\n\nSeth Rogan as pumba might be the worst casting of all time. He is so incredibly not funny and nearly every scene he is in pulls me out of the movie. Mufasa could have been improved by taking out all the present day story telling scenes.

It doesn\'t matter how good the live action animation gets there is nothing you can do to make a real lion look like it\'s actually singing.

This isnt a family movie. Kids will be bored after 30 minutes tops .

They know how to craft a crowd-pleasing delight full of laughter, heart and decadent artistry of the highest calibre. The visuals in Mufasa are beyond anything in your wildest imagination. Mufasa is exactly why audiences keep coming back for more and more of Disney's extraordinary filmmaking. You can tell so much heart and love went into this film. Add Mufasa to a long list of such achievements equal to another new classic, last year's the Little Mermaid. Mufasa continues the legacy of the Lion King in fresh new ways never before seen with captivating visuals that will leave you exhausted from their pure enchantment. My children adored this film. The songs are full of light and charm, and will leave kids singing them out loud on the car ride home, with their special Mufasa popcorn buckets and special Mufasa soda cups planted firmly next to them; special souvenirs that will be treasured for many years to come. Thank you Disney for doing the Lord's work and providing us with classic after classic, year after year. Can't wait for Snow White next year. I dare say it'll surpass Mufasa and be the fairest of them all."", 'Barry Jenkins\' Mufasa: The Lion King offers a visually breathtaking journey into the origins of one of Disney\'s most iconic characters. Directed by the Academy Award-winning filmmaker behind Moonlight, the prequel ambitiously expands the universe of The Lion King, but its storytelling lacks the ferocity and emotional depth to match its stunning visuals.\n\nThe film revisits the Pride Lands in photorealistic glory, rendered with even more precision and vibrancy than the 2019 remake. The African savannah bursts to life with bolder hues and intricate details, while the digital animation captures the texture of fur, the shimmer of water, and the sway of tall grasses with uncanny realism. Yet, beneath this visual spectacle lies a narrative that feels formulaic and overly safe, failing to capture the grandeur or emotional resonance of its predecessors.\n\nMufasa: The Lion King centers on the young cub\'s journey to greatness, voiced by Braelyn Rankins as a cub and Aaron Pierre as an adult. Mufasa\'s origin unfolds through segmented flashbacks, narrated by the ever-wise Rafiki (John Kani). The film explores Mufasa\'s displacement, his adoption into a new pride, and his bond with his adoptive brother Taka (voiced by Theo Somolu and Kelvin Harrison Jr.), who later becomes Scar. This central relationship introduces tension and hints at deeper themes of rivalry, loyalty, and destiny.\n\nThe film takes risks with its colonial undertones, notably through a pride of white-furred antagonists led by the menacing Kiros (Mads Mikkelsen). This narrative thread adds a layer of sociopolitical commentary, evoking themes of dominance and survival in a rapidly changing landscape. However, these moments of daring are undercut by Disney\'s reluctance to stray too far from its family-friendly formula. The result is a film that occasionally touches on deeper issues but ultimately retreats into the safety of predictable tropes.\n\nThe voice cast elevates the material, with Keith David as the dignified Masego and Anika Noni Rose as the nurturing Afia. Pierre\'s adult Mufasa imbues the character with quiet strength, while John Kani\'s Rafiki delivers wisdom with warmth and gravitas. Even so, the performances cannot fully overcome the limitations of the script, which leans heavily on exposition and uninspired dialogue. Lin-Manuel Miranda\'s contributions to the soundtrack, while energetic, fail to produce a standout anthem that could rival ""Circle of Life"" or ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight.""\n\nRomantic subplots, such as Mufasa\'s courtship of Sarabi (Tiffany Boone), feel shoehorned and underdeveloped. The film\'s attempts at humor through Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) veer into redundancy, offering little more than recycled gags from previous installments. Jenkins\' artistry is evident in the film\'s quieter moments, such as Mufasa\'s reflective scenes under the starlit sky, but these moments are few and far between.\n\nAt its heart, Mufasa: The Lion King is a story about identity, resilience, and the unyielding pull of destiny. Yet, the film struggles to carve out a unique identity of its own, feeling more like an extension of Disney\'s corporate strategy than a bold new chapter in the Lion King saga. While it successfully expands the visual boundaries of animated storytelling, its narrative limitations and reliance on nostalgia leave much to be desired.\n\nThe addition of a colonial allegory introduces some much-needed tension, but the execution lacks the sharpness to make a lasting impact. Kiros and his pride of white-furred lions symbolize a looming external threat, adding stakes to Mufasa\'s rise to power. However, these themes are only lightly explored, leaving the audience craving more depth and nuance.\n\nVisually, the film is a masterpiece. The animation captures every detail, from the velvet of a lion\'s fur to the sparkle of dew on the savannah grass. The environments are so meticulously rendered that they feel almost tangible, a testament to the technological advancements in animation. Jenkins\' use of light and shadow further enhances the cinematic experience, creating a visual feast that immerses the viewer in the Pride Lands.\n\nHowever, for all its visual splendor, Mufasa: The Lion King falls short in delivering a compelling narrative. The film feels weighed down by its obligation to expand the franchise rather than telling a story that stands on its own. The pacing is uneven, with moments of brilliance scattered among stretches of predictability. The dialogue often feels stilted, relying on exposition rather than organic character development.\n\nMufasa: The Lion King is a film of contrasts. It soars visually but struggles narratively. It introduces daring themes but hesitates to explore them fully. It\'s a prequel that promises to enrich the Lion King lore but ends up feeling like a shadow of its predecessors. While it will undoubtedly delight younger audiences and fans of the franchise, it lacks the depth and originality to leave a lasting impression.\n\nJenkins\' creative choices, particularly his attention to the visual aspects and casting, underscore his capability as a filmmaker. Yet, the film\'s adherence to Disney\'s formulaic storytelling restricts its potential to be something truly groundbreaking. The themes of familial bonds, societal hierarchies, and individual growth are explored but never fully developed, leaving viewers yearning for more substance beneath the glittering surface.\n\nThe climax, while visually arresting, feels rushed, depriving the audience of a deeply satisfying resolution. The film\'s exploration of Mufasa\'s rise to leadership, intertwined with Taka\'s descent into jealousy and betrayal, offers glimpses of narrative depth but ultimately remains underexplored. The colonial allegory, though intriguing, is handled with such subtlety that its impact is diminished.\n\nUltimately, Mufasa: The Lion King is a visual triumph but a narrative compromise. It stands as a testament to the power of technology in storytelling while serving as a reminder that even the most stunning visuals cannot replace a deeply resonant story. Fans of the Lion King universe will appreciate the expansion of its mythology, but casual viewers may find themselves longing for the magic and emotional depth of the original.', ""The only good thing about this 2 hour CGI exhibition is that it will inspire you to re-watch the original Lion King to rinse off the brain rot you incur while watching it.\n\nNo heart or humanity radiates from these creepy, anthropomorphized, neutered CGI lions. The kids we went with were bored within 5 minutes. Parents, you will be checking how much time is left on your phones.\n\nThe only funny part was how awful the songs were. It felt like they were improvised first drafts of a musically inclined high schooler. A few of them mostly repeated the same line over and over again. Our whole row was laughing.\n\nThe writing and acting felt just as lacking in truth and beauty as the animation. The script felt like a first draft written with some AI assistance in a rush. The voices were badly cast and prioritized celebrity over character.\n\nIt's sad that the value placed on deep and honest storytelling continues to decline in modern cinema and that Hollywood continues to empower mediocre talent, endlessly subjecting us to this onslaught of dumbed down and recycled ideas. Movies like this, and like so many these days, are clearly made with more love and respect for the mighty dollar than their audiences."", 'Mufasa, is an amazing backstory of our beloved titular character as it provides us with an insight as to how he became the Lion King.

How will his life about others this movie shows at the peak level. Musafa is a character to every kids getting motivating by their parents to be. At the ALSO characters like JAADU, MONKEY which is his history. How musafa obtained with others jungle members to fight against WHITE LIONS(evils) , this films shows really well."", ""It's a decent attempt at telling the story of how Mufasa came to be. The writers did okay in getting you to care about Mufasa but overall the storyline was weak. You can say contrived, but I'll give it some leeway as it needs to end up at at the original starting point.\n\nWhile we all love Miranda's Alexander Hamilton songs, the songs in Mufasa seemed weak and did not allow the singers to shine. This is something that most Disney musicals try to create. Having Hans Zimmer's score and Miranda's music seemed conflicting to me. For me the best song was I always wanted a brother and it worked within the story well.\n\nI'm sure Disney went through at least 50 story lines, but it felt like they tried to rush the story to get the work done. Perhap's because of James Earl Jones failing health. Bit the best story or movie but it works."", ""My childhood favourite, now watching with my child again and getting to see Mufasa and the treacherous younger brother's backstory is such an experience that you become a child again and share a slice of your childhood favourite to the next generation 💚 It was a visual treat to watch in IMAX 3D, absolutely loved every single frame. The voice actors all did an excellent job, what excites me more is the ensemble voice cast in Tamil language though I could not watch the Tamil version.\n\nAll in all it is worth watching in the big screen and the timing is great too as watching Mufasa in the big screens made my Xmas holiday break even more special."", 'Mufasa: The Lion King has a number of exciting and even thrilling moments. The action is well done, and there are some fine scenes of danger and adventurous tension. Unfortunately, the film is heavily burdened by bad songs and incessant interruptions from Timon and Pumba trying to be cute and funny every time the story is starting to get good. As a big fan of Lin Manuel Miranda from his legendary musical Hamilton, I am sad to report that Mufasa is a new career low for him. The song ""Bye bye"" will have you cringing out of your skin and ""I Always Wanted A Brother"" will make you want to gouge out your eardrums every time you hear the word ""brother."" ""Milele"" is decent, but none of the original songs or score remotely approach the levels of Elton John\'s and Hans Zimmer\'s music from 1994\'s Lion King.\n\nFinally, the villain arc is really thinly developed and I didn\'t find it credible at all. The abruptness and irrationality of the turn reminded me of Anakin Skywalker\'s quick spin to the dark side in Revenge of the Sith. All this said, it\'s not a bad movie but it could have and should have been much better.', ""I loved the original movie and this just didn't honour remotely the masterpiece we all fell in love with. This prequel felt fake or forced and I couldn't connect to any characters. Possibly Rafiki resembled original character. This was underwhelming. Visuals, voices and storyline all didn't synch or captivate attention. Felt like a missed opportunity and let down. None of the characters were strong and most of them didn't feel like they had the true essence of the characters we loved from the animation. If I am busy making coffee and finding snacks throughout a movie or fall asleep when not tired it's not a good sign. Not sure how it's been nominated for best visual effects. All of it didn't gel. Let down for one of the best characters and the best voice of Lion King.

The documentary Supermarionation provides a useful reference point, the development of created dynamic imagery from that time to Mufasa is astounding.

I enjoyed the 2019 Lion King movie fine, but I kinda get it.\n\nMoving on to Mufasa: The Lion King. The story is okay, the songs are mid, and the voice acting is good. It\'s not gonna win a whole lot of people over but for what it is it\'s not half bad. There is actually a ton of good here, and it\'s a fun enough movie.\n\nIf you liked The Lion King, the original, the remake, or both, check this movie out.

I think we definitely needed to see more of Mufasa's background, especially the relevance of Scar in his life. Scar's story was honestly heartbreaking, and although not justifying his actions, I think you begin to understand the villain a bit more in this movie. It had great life lessons, similar to the first movie and had light humour here and there which I enjoyed, as I think it's a movie you don't expect to actually be emotional but it is. It is not just a light backstory of Mufasa, it taught us a lot. I would recommend everyone to watch this movie, especially if you're a fan of the first Lion King.

A reimagining of ""Nosferatu"" at his helm seemed like a dream come true, and after many years, it finally came to fruition with somewhat mixed results.\n\nAs with the original 1922 film and Werner Herzog\'s surreal 1979 remake, Eggers mostly honors the source material here. The original film itself was a blatant derivative of ""Dracula,"" so anyone who knows the bones of that classic story will more or less already have the lay of the land in terms of what happens in ""Nosferatu"".\n\nFirstly, the attention to detail here is impeccable; the period costumes and sets are dazzling, and the cinematography is top-notch, with repeated uses of muted grey nighttime sequences that border on black-and-white (intentional I\'m sure, as an ode to the Murnau original). In the latter act, as rats and plague take over the streets, there is a palpable sense of rot that is highly effective. Given that Eggers has proven his excellence in these departments with his previous films, it is no surprise that the finer details and visuals are uniformly stunning.\n\nAs far as performances are concerned, we have a strong cast here. Lily-Rose Depp (whom I\'d never seen in anything prior to this) gave a formidable performance as the haunted Ellen Hutter, who is pursued by Count Orlok (Bill Skarsgard), a malevolent vampire whose connection to her is emboldened when her husband Thomas (Nicholas Hoult) is assigned to handle estate matters for the Count. Willem Dafoe is as spunky as ever here as an occult expert who attempts to help the Hutters, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Emma Corrin give effective performances as the Hardings, friends of the Hutters who oversee the troubled Ellen while Thomas travels to Orlok.\n\nAll of these aforementioned elements give the film a real leg up, and approximately the first half of it (largely consisting of Thomas\'s travels into Transylvania and first encounter with Orlok) are engrossing and beautifully contrasted with Ellen\'s ""melancholic"" (and eventually possession-like) episodes back in urban Germany. However, once the story returns its focus to the city, the film seems to stall its momentum. One of the notable differences in this reimagining is that the focus revolves more around the Ellen character (aptly named ""Lucy Harker"" in Herzog\'s version) and the Hardings, but the unfortunate thing is that it never feels like the audience gets to know them any better for it. This is especially so in the case of Ellen, whose character has a slightly different spin in Eggers\'s screenplay, specifically in terms of her relationship to Orlok. The result feels like something of a missed opportunity, and the proverbial stake is driven in even further when one considers the film\'s running time, which is considerably longer than both the 1922 and 1979 versions, and yet those films often feel more involved. There is a strange amorphousness about the 2024 version\'s latter half that left it feeling enervated, especially against the ominous and suspenseful first hour.\n\nThe film\'s conclusion will hold no surprises for those who already know the previous films, but Eggers\'s staging of it is nonetheless spectacular and visually effective--and this is a fact that remains true about the film as a whole. Unfortunately, it does stumble a bit in the latter half as it seems to attempt to expand the material without ever fully reaching a satisfactory fever pitch. All that being said, the film is a gothic visual marvel in its own right, upheld by stunning cinematography and uniformly solid performances. It is imperfect, but it is a showstopper in more ways than one. 7/10.', 'Nosferatu is a haunting and terrifying gothic horror love story. In my opinion, it is Robert Eggers best film he\'s done to date. Lily-Rose Depp (Ellen Hutter) and Bill Skarsgård (Count Orlok) give chilling performances. Nicholas Hoult (Thomas Hutter), Willem Dafoe (Prof. Albin Eberhart Von Franz), and Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Friedrich Harding) are exceptional in this movie as well. Really great casting all around for this film. The cinematography is perfect, Robert Eggers does a masterful job at using the shadows to his advantage. Every scene in this movie is visually stunning. From the moment the film begins there is a sense of dread that sets in and you can feel it creeping closer and closer throughout the film every time a character says ""He is coming"". Overall, this a really well made film that any movie lover, not just horror, should watch and appreciate.', ""Beautiful is not a word that I enjoy using for a film with such a muted color pallet. However, for Robert Eggers' Nosferatu, after viewing it in it's entirety, it is the only word that comes to mind.\n\nEggers has constructed this film meticulously, with a precision seen in very few directors these days. Heck, more so than any previous effort he's put to screen. You can tell he enjoys working with a bigger budget and he know what to do with it as well. Lavish, gothic set design and costumes across the board. Wonderful special FX, both CG and practical makeup. The cinematography was insane. Sweeping camera shots and uncomfortable closeups, all framed in a 35mm letterbox format. It was a spectacle worth the wait, especially on the IMAX screen I saw it on.\n\nThe acting was phenomenonal. Lily Rose-Depp should win awards for her all out performance. Both horrific and touching all at the same time. Willem Dafoe provided some much needed spice for the second half. Without his character, the film would've slipped a star as the story starts getting a little long winded towards the end. My only gripe with the cast was Bill Skarsgård as Count Orlok. I felt he could've played into the character's sensitivity a bit more. He was cold hearted, yes, but he did still have love in his heart.\n\nThe story, adapted from both Dracula and Nosferatu... but mostly Nosferatu, was very well written. With dialog that felt natural and authentic to the time period, another one of Eggers specialty, the film flowed rather nicely and almost transports you to that time and place. Impressively, when the film does eventually start gettint bogged down a bit, Eggers makes sure to pick things right back up again to never keep the audience bored, and with a film like this that could've happened easily.\n\nOverall, a pretty great adaptation of a classic story. Equal parts horror and mystery, and a bittersweet ending that almost made me cry. I loved it, and a nice addition to Robert Eggers' growing filmography.\n\n4 coffins out of 5."", ""I recently saw the original Nosferatu for the first time. I don't think it would be possible for a modern remake to come closer to capturing that film's sense of dread than Eggers' remake. Eggers has obviously made a dedicated study of the original and was determined to do justice to its legacy. He masterfully manipulates the shot and the sound to construct a world where it is always night. I have not felt so immersed in a movie for a long time, to the point where I felt almost like I myself was hypnotized by the vampire's spell. It's a kind of wordless terror which very, very few horror movies manage to elicit. The closest parallel is the Weimar classics. I think all of the negative reviews I've read were made by people who simply don't understand horror."", 'Greetings again from the darkness. My first exposure to Count Orlok was in a film class at the University of Texas. We were shown a portion of director FW Murneau\'s 1922 silent film, NOSFERATU: A SYMPHONY OF HORROR. I was mesmerized with the look of the film and especially with Max Schreck as Orlok. While growing up, I fawned over other vampire movies - Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney Jr, Christopher Lee, and even Frank Langella - but I never again saw anything like Schreck\'s Orlock. And yes, over the years, vampires have become frequent subjects of movies and even TV shows, and ""Nosferatu"", based on the original Bram Stoker story from 1897 spawned NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE (1979, directed by Werner Herzog, starring Klaus Kinski) and NOSFERATU (2023, directed by David Lee Fisher, starring Doug Jones). My anticipation soared when it was announced that the extraordinarily creative filmmaker Robert Eggers (THE WITCH, 2015; THE LIGHTHOUSE, 2109; THE NORTHMAN, 2022) would be basing his version on Henrik Galeen\'s script from the 1922 original.\n\nAt its core, the story is a gothic tale of a woman haunted by the terrifying vampire obsessed with her. The ""her"" is Ellen Hutter played by Lily-Rose Depp (WOLF, 2021, and yes she\'s Johnny Depp\'s daughter). Ellen\'s husband is Thomas Hutter played by Nicholas Hoult (familiar with the look of this genre via WARM BODIES, 2013, and RENFIELD, 2023). When Thomas\' job takes him out of town, friends Friedrich Harding (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Anna Harding (Emma Corrin, DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE, 2024) invite Ellen to stay with them. It turns out the work Thomas is assigned is a real estate transaction with a mysterious recluse named Count Orlok. You may have experienced a bad real estate deal in your life, but it\'s nothing like this one.\n\nWhen it becomes apparent that Ellen\'s trauma is not merely nerves, but rather an evil spiritual presence, the expertise of Professor Albin Eberhart von Franz is sought in an attempt to gain some control. The professor is played by Willem Dafoe, who once portrayed the aforementioned Max Schreck in SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE (2000). Playing Count Orlok this time is Bill Skarsgard, who you likely recall was superb as Pennywise the Dancing Clown in IT (2017) and IT CHAPTER TWO (2019). Skarsgard\'s actual features are undetectable here, and especially jarring is his voice that truly sounds from another world (supposedly months of training). His Orlok is a true and memorable presence.\n\nEggers\' film looks stunning and gorgeous and creepy. The opening sequence is fascinating and everything one could ask for in how a vampire horror movie appears on screen. He surrounded himself with previous collaborators: Director of Photography Jarin Blaschke, Production Designer Craig Lathrop, Costume Designer Linda Muir, Film Editor Louis Ford, and Composer Robin Carolan. It\'s an excellent team and one that excels at every step. My only issue with the film comes down to the cast. Lily-Rose Depp has the perfect look for the character, yet her torment never quite works. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and (the usually stellar) Willem Dafoe both seem to be showboating as if attempting to stand out in a movie dominated by a fearsome creature. It pains me to say that the cast (other than Skarsgard) simply take away some of the impact that the film should have had. Despite this, the film is lyrical, mystifying, and absolutely glorious in its look.\n\nOpens in theaters on December 25, 2024.', ""Rating - 8.6: Overall, a very good horror movie that establishes Robert Eggers as an auteur in the genre as he remakes a horror classic with his vision.\n\nDirection - Very Good: The direction on a macroscale feels very grand, with a gothic aesthetic that pays homage to the original story; His direction on a grand scale shows how he is truly an auteur in the horror genre; The direction on a microscale is good, as it brings the most out of these actors and helps establish the gothic, European scene; The storytelling is very good, as he uses tension to move the story forward, as you are on the edge of your seat to see what happens next; He builds tension masterfully, as the whole movie relies on tension to bring out the horror elements and move the story forward\n\nStory - Good: The concept is a remake of the silent film classic Nosferatu, an unofficial adaptation of Dracula; The plot structure is pretty standard, though the movie does drag at some moments and the build to the climax was a bit boring; The character writing is very good as they do a good job bringing to life these classic characters\n\nScreenplay - Good to Very Good: The dialogue is polished and very Gothic and true to the time period; The foreshadowing is very good, as the movie uses roots planted throughout to help close the movie in the end\n\nActing - Good to Very Good: Bill Skarsgård - Pretty Good to Good (Plays a menacing Count Orlok well in a way unique to previous interpretations; It took a while for me to get used to it but I stuck the landing in the end), Nicholas Hoult - Good (Carries the movie well and feels polished in showing his range), Lily-Rose Depp - Very Good to Great (A true scream queen, as she shows a wide range of emotions to show the distraught of her experience; she has very good chemistry with the rest of the cast; it really feels like Eggers' muse when making this movie), Aaron Taylor-Johnson - Decent to Pretty Good (It feels like he is hitting a limit in his acting as he does not match the level of his other castmates; but he holds his own), Emma Corrin - Pretty Good (Plays her role well), Willem Dafoe - Good (A very typical Willem Dafoe performance;), Simon McBurney - Very Good (It really shows the demented nature of the character as he will do anything for Count Orlok), Rest of the cast - Good (This movie is more about the main cast, but the cast as a whole really feels like they did their job in making this an engaging experience)\n\nScore - Good: Used very well to build tension;\n\nCinematography - Great: Helps make this movie feel both gothic yet auteur-esque to Eggers' vision\n\nEditing - Very Good: Helps make this movie feel polished; helps establish the tension and horror elements\n\nSound - Very Good: Helps build tension and make this a horrifying movie; Might have just been my Dolby Cinema theater, but the subwoofers under the seat made this movie feel like a 4D experience\n\nVisual Effects - Very Good: Helped make this movie feel genuinely scary and grotesque;\n\nProduction Design - Great: Helped create this Gothic landscape that brings to life the time period and Orlok's castle\n\nMakeup - Incredible: It really brings to life Count Orlok and the horror elements with the blood\n\nCostumes - Great: Helps bring to life the time period and paint Count Orlok\n\nPacing - Pacing is fine for the most part, but feels a bit slow at some moments; Maybe 15-20 minutes could have been cut to keep the pace consistent\n\nClimax - Climax is good as it brings together all of that tension; The build to the climax dragged a bit as it was a bit boring\n\nTone - Tone is very Gothic horror;\n\nFinal Notes - My experience in Dolby Cinema felt like a 4D experience, with the subwoofer blasting the sound."", 'Perhaps it was the lofty expectations or Robert Eggers\' (until now, in my opinion) unbroken string of masterpieces, but Nosferatu feels like a bit of a disappointment.\n\nAll of the ingredients are there. Nosferatu deserves accolades for incredible costumes and sets, the dialog is poetic and period appropriate, and the cinematography is GORGEOUS. We\'ve come to expect this from Eggers and cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, who has worked on all of Eggers\' past films. The visuals are truly striking and memorable; the shadowy hand across the German town of Wisburg where it takes place or the image of Nicholas Hoult\'s Thomas walking in a snow forest.: impeccable.\n\nThe performances are - mostly - fantastic. I was struck by how likable Aaron Taylor Johnson was here; he gives perhaps the best performance of his career in this movie. Willem Dafoe, Nicholas Hoult, Ralph Ineson, Emma Corrin...are all great.\n\nLily Rose-Depp delivers a star making performance in this film for sure, but is she really THAT much better than Nell Tiger-Free in this year\'s First Omen? They do very similar things, but one movie came out in April and is a horror prequel and the other is a prestige December release from acclaimed director Robert Eggers. I wouldn\'t normally bring up a ""comparative"" performance, but given how similar these are, I can\'t help it.\n\nAnd the reason I do that is...her character - Ellen - is not written particularly well. Rose-Depp can do a mean possession, but there isn\'t much to her character beyond that, as opposed to what I saw from Free in The First Omen.\n\nI also feel mixed things about Bill Skarsgård\'s Count Orlock. As usual, Skarsgård is incredible from a purely performative aspect and truly melts away into the role. However, the movie\'s interpretation of Orlock didn\'t work for me at all; his goofy accent and moustache, his copious screen time, and overbearing dialog was more funny than intimidating. You can\'t have a character deemed ""worse than evil,"" and have him give off Count Chocula vibes. I\'m sorry. This is one scenario where less is decidedly more and the amount of time we see Orlock actively hurts the film.\n\nBut the worst thing about Nosferatu is its pacing, editing, and storytelling. The film has a nightmarish, disorienting vibe in the beginning - which makes sense - and then completely abandons this tone by the second half, becoming far more conventional. In a sense, I kind of wish this movie stuck to its weirdness a bit more; it really should\'ve gone HARDER, but I\'m fairly certain studio interference got in the way.\n\nIt also doesn\'t really convey information all too well, with confusing editing that puts scenes out of place and lines of - already somewhat hard to understand - dialog intended to convey MAJOR plot points. (Two scenes stick out to me: one where Ellen and Tom are arguing only for it to cut in a way that implies she\'s going with him to Romania, but they just go his friend\'s house, and another where his ""night"" at Count Orlock\'s house is just bereft of any tension or intrigue, because the shots are compiled so confusingly).\n\nThe film starts off shockingly quickly, giving us no moment to breathe and soak in the world we\'re seeing on screen. It hits the ground running yet feels simultaneously too long and too rushed.\n\nWe barely learn anything about our characters and as such, I struggle to see what this Nosferatu is even supposed to be about. The subject matter as presented is ripe for themes like female emancipation, sexual desire, the darker aspects of humanity (stuff that\'s mentioned), but the movie never gets a chance to really explore any of this.\n\nSo, while I don\'t think Nosferatu is a BAD movie by any means, it doesn\'t accede to anything beyond ""just fine"" to me right now. A technically brilliant, well acted, but ultimately, kind of tepid story.', 'This film did nothing that Coppola\'s 1992 Bram Stoker\'s Dracula didn\'t already do. Coppola\'s film both thematically, and visually broke ground (costumes, creature design, set pieces, etc.), and had a far more expository, but also sinister and apprehensive feel. Not to mention it was also far more carnal. Nosferatu on the other hand, just felt like a tamer, ""nothing new to see here"" re-make, with nothing remotely original in any depictions. Maybe if Nosferatu looked scarier than a bald Vlad Teppish (""The Impaler"", ""Dracul""), that might\'ve helped. I give it a 5-6 with a ""I wouldn\'t watch it again"" rating.', ""This movie was pretty freaking amazing. If your a fan of Robert Egger's other work you will love this movie. Perfectly Gothic tone and dark vibes. The acting was very good especially Lily Rose Depp. It was pretty scary and didn't hold back on the nudity. It's not graphic nudity or exploitative but it was there. Something that the older films couldn't do because of the time. It fits perfectly in this movie. Yes there are some major and some subtle changes from the other films as should be done with a remake. Not gorey either so if you hate gore, your safe for this one. It's pretty slow until the end but it was pretty nice payoff and some intentionally funny scenes keep it from being a slog fest. Overall my expectations were met with this one. 9/10."", ""Every artist should strive to put as much meticulous love and care into their work as Robert Eggers. A melancholy love letter to European painters of old and folklore/horror history from both film and literature. Packaged in a unique kind of visionary treat for the senses. It's time that the horror genre is no longer pushed aside at the Oscars and that this film is given the recognition it deserves.\n\nIt was a privilege to experience this, including a beautifully dynamic Dolby Atmos soundtrack mix within in a dead silent audience, on Christmas Day 2024. An authentic and masterfully acted occult drama fairy tale! Next week we will at least go back for the IMAX premiere <3\n\n(Atmos is the highest fidelity experience available until then in the Netherlands.)\n\n10/10."", ""This movie is very well made, many of the set pieces look absolutely gorgeous, the costumes are beautiful, and the whole vibe of the film captures the early 19th century amazingly well.\n\nAnd despite how good some of the acting is in this film, it failed completely to connect with me on an emotional level. I cared about none of these characters, and the only one I enjoyed having on my screen was Willem Dafoe.\n\nIf this movie had spent more time building up relationships and making stakes matter, I would've rated this way higher. But visuals can carry a movie only for so long until boredom sets in. And this is what I ended up feeling after about halfway through it's runtime."", ""F. W. Murnau's (illegally adapted) 1922 film Nosferatu presented the vampire as a sickly, batlike elf. In the new 'Nosferatu,' Robert Eggers introduces an off-putting new look for Count Orlok, but Nosferatu (2024) is an unnecessary retelling of Murnau's original film wrapped in mediocrity. It reflects a trend of nostalgia and reboots. Innovation takes a backseat to reverence in the foreground. This is an exercise in indulgence that only the MMXXV Generation will enjoy. Visually, the film is overblown in its impressionistic palette. Coppola's Dracula was visually more imposing, combining opulent gothic imagery with operatic intensity. Herzog's Nosferatu (1979) had more haunting, austere beauty. And Carl Dreyer's Vampyr (1932) was more dreamlike."", 'I had no idea what to really expect with this movie. I purposely avoided any info on it (I know the original), purposely avoided looking up the cast and purposely avoided watching the trailer. I came out very pleasantly surprised. Regarding the director I didn\'t love ""The Witch"" as much as other people seemed to. I thought ""The Lighthouse"" was interesting but odd. This one really had me impressed and had a perfect cast! Lily Rose Depp does a PHENOMENAL job especially. She genuinely creeped me out at several parts and I\'m a hard one to scare. I thought the charisma with the cast was really good as well. I actually had no idea who played Count Orlok and was shocked to see it was Skarsgard. That showed me what a fantastic job they did on the makeup. I think it was a little long but I think any movie over 2 hours is too long. That being said it held my attention the entire time and I never found myself wanting to know how much time was left. It was unfortunate because I missed the first 5-10 minutes due to a theatre chair being broken so I was a little confused who Aaron Taylor Johnson was in relation to Lily Rose Depp the entire time. The audience seemed to really enjoy it... with one guy trying to gather an applause afterwards which didn\'t work out in his favor and was a little cringe, but I personally haven\'t seen anyone attempt to clap after a showing before. I didn\'t see anyone get up to leave during the movie which is rare for a packed theatre with the length of the film. I\'ve been just sitting here pondering the film for several hours and I love movies that make you think like that! Creepy/ true gothic aesthetic. I also appreciated small details like I noticed the men wearing their wedding rings on their right fingers which was true to that area and time period. I\'m extremely into the fashion from that time period and they did an excellent job with that as well. I will buy this movie when it comes out. It\'s truly not just a film but a work of art!', ""Robert Eggers revitalizes the iconic vampire tale with Nosferatu, delivering a haunting and visually stunning ode to F. W. Murnau's 922 classic.\n\nRobert Eggers' Nosferatu emerges as a haunting revival of one of cinema's most iconic tales, delivering a film that is as much an homage to the 1922 masterpiece by F. W. Murnau as it is a testament to Eggers' unique voice as a filmmaker. With meticulous attention to detail, Eggers weaves a chilling and visually sumptuous retelling that not only honors its silent-era predecessor but also elevates the gothic horror genre for a modern audience.\n\nSet in a desolate seaside town, Eggers reimagines the story of Count Orlok (Bill Skarsgård) and his tragic pursuit of Ellen (Lily-Rose Depp), infusing it with themes of isolation, longing, and the destructive nature of obsession. From the moment the film opens, Eggers establishes a world drenched in dread, with shadowy visuals that evoke the spirit of German Expressionism. Jarin Blaschke's cinematography masterfully plays with light and shadow, creating an atmosphere where every frame feels like a painting come to life, amplifying the unease that permeates the story.\n\nAt the heart of the film is Bill Skarsgård's magnetic performance as Count Orlok. Skarsgård embodies the vampiric predator with a mixture of menace and melancholy, capturing the tragic duality of a creature cursed by his eternal hunger. His physicality-lean, angular, and otherworldly-makes Orlok both terrifying and pitiable, a monster bound by his nature yet yearning for connection. Lily-Rose Depp delivers a career-defining turn as Ellen, imbuing her character with quiet strength and vulnerability. Ellen's tragic arc serves as the emotional backbone of the narrative, making her fate all the more devastating.\n\nEggers masterfully balances the grotesque and the beautiful, immersing the audience in a gothic world where every shadow hides a secret, and every silence carries the weight of impending doom. The supporting cast further enriches the film. Willem Dafoe, an Eggers regular, brings gravitas and a touch of madness to his role, while Anya Taylor-Joy delivers a layered performance that underscores the human cost of the supernatural conflict. Together, the cast forms a cohesive ensemble that grounds the story's more fantastical elements in emotional truth.\n\nMark Korven's score is another standout element, providing a haunting soundscape that elevates the tension and underscores the film's themes of despair and inevitability. The music seamlessly blends with the visuals, enhancing moments of quiet horror and sudden violence. Eggers' commitment to historical authenticity is evident not only in the set design and costumes but also in the language of the film itself. Every line of dialogue feels deliberate, contributing to the rich texture of this gothic world.\n\nNosferatu is a deeply immersive experience, one that demands the viewer's full attention. Eggers' deliberate pacing may test the patience of some, but it rewards those willing to linger in its shadowy corridors. The climactic sequences are both terrifying and heartbreaking, driving home the film's exploration of mortality, sacrifice, and the thin line between love and obsession. It is a story that feels both timeless and achingly contemporary, resonating with modern audiences while remaining faithful to its origins.\n\nEggers' retelling stands apart from the many adaptations of Nosferatu that have preceded it, not just through its visual splendor but also through its psychological depth. This is a tale that refuses to reduce its characters to archetypes, instead imbuing them with humanity and complexity. Orlok is not merely a monster; he is a tragic figure caught in an eternal cycle of despair. Ellen is not just a victim; she is a beacon of hope and resilience. Together, their intertwined fates create a narrative that is as moving as it is harrowing.\n\nIn an era of disposable entertainment, Nosferatu stands out as a film that refuses to compromise its vision. It is a masterclass in gothic horror, showcasing Eggers' unparalleled talent for world-building and storytelling. For fans of the genre and lovers of cinema, it is an unmissable experience that reminds us why these stories endure. Eggers has not just remade Nosferatu; he has redefined it for a new generation, proving that even the most familiar tales can still inspire awe."", ""Lushly beautiful with fine period costumes, lovely cinematography, and a hard-working Lily-Rose Depp in thrall to the vampire, this adaptation of Nosferatu ultimately falls flat by too many hypnotized fits by Depp, too much exposition, and a villain that grows less interesting with every appearance until he finally appears looking like an undead Ringo Starr on a stretch-rack. Nicholas Hoult is commanding in the Jonathan Harker role and it's clever to cast Willem Dafoe in the Van Helsing role since he played Count Orlock in 1999's much better Shadow of The Vampire, but this ultimately lacks bite."", 'Most of the world is populated by dumb people. You can be certain while reading some of the reviews that fail to understand what Eggers did here. Light, shadows, every scene is a piece of art. Caravaggio, Van Gogh, you can see them while watching this movie. Should we talk about how Eggers deals from a psychological standpoint the thematic of rape? Or what about the women condition, repressed beings and thus lean to cultivate an evil inside that hollows them? An evil that drains them of their lives. Should we talk about the religious thematic? A redemption for women, given the fact that Ellen dies to redeem humanity of its sins.\n\nBut this is just peanuts comparing to the magnificence of Eggers movie. Watch it more than once and enjoy every detail that contains. This is our Nosferatu, this is our legacy.', ""This is, at every level, an excellent film. It would be so easy to trip from suspenseful horror into camp, but they have judged this perfectly.\n\nThe film, as with all art, repays even a small amount of background research, I can recommend the Wikipedia page on the word 'Nosferatu' as a good start.\n\nWell-judged references to the 1922 version, atmospheric sets and a good soundscape all contribute.\n\nWell acted, directed and edited, my only criticism is that Nosferatu himself, is a bit too substantial, something more wraith like, more cadavers would, I feel, have worked better, think of Joquin Phoenix in Jocker Follie a deluxe."", ""Don't get me wrong the film is sumptuous and filmically stunning. But that I am afraid that for all this the film is simply dull.\n\nThe protagonist Orlok looks like Jim Carrey in Lemony Snickets, with a moustache. He just doesn't fill the film with menace.\n\nThe acting is hammy and trying far too hard to be a work of art rather than a slice of entertainment.\n\nMiss Depp however died come out of it with some credit and is definitely one to watch for the future.\n\nWillem Defoe is simply Willem Defoe mar as a box of frogs but always madly watchable.\n\nSo as a New Year commences I am hoping that the other films I am waiting for don't disappoint like Nosferatu today."", 'I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. I expected more daring and original filmmaking decisions considering the director.\n\nAs it started off, I was feeling the Robert Eggers effect. Count Orlok is truly terrifying when we first meet him in his castle. He\'s mysterious and creepy and compelling-in two places at once and his voice somehow booming and quiet at the same time. It made my skin crawl. Nicholas Hoult\'s convincing utter terror increased my fear and anxiety.\n\nBut by the time Orlok reaches ""Germany,"" (which incidentally didn\'t exist yet as a country in the year 1838, despite the film being set there--it would have made more sense to say ""Prussia"" or ""modern day Germany""), he\'s lost almost all his sinister effect. Keep in mind, this happens quite early on in the movie.\n\nOrlok becomes too visible and physical and real. Rather than this ancient, otherworldly, unknown figure, he becomes this almost comical man/creature with a silly mustache. By the end of the movie, his makeup looks just like that-makeup. Close up and in the bright light, his ""undead"" skin looks like a rubber suit with holes. By the last shot of the film, I had to keep myself from laughing out loud because of how silly he looked.\n\nMy other major complaint with this film was the lack of exposition and character development. I simply did not care about these characters. Lily-Rose Depp gave a good physical performance, but the film could have benefitted from fewer ""fits"" on her part and more time providing a backstory, thereby making us invested in the characters.\n\nI much prefer Coppola\'s 1992 Dracula to this, and it\'s not like that\'s one of my favorite films. It does a much better job telling this story.', ""In general, Nosferatu has a lot going for it. It has a decent story with great product production value that gives you a great sense of terror and dread when you're dealing with the vampire parts. It's the in-between that really sinks it.\n\nIn general, the production value is the best asset of this movie. What they did in post production in marvels for the movie. The color grading they used for certain scenes were amazing. Peter gave it a real noir field. The score was brilliant to build up tension. There were some great jump, scare scenes, exemplified by the post production score and lighting.\n\nThe characters were decent and well thought out. The dialogue was decent and again well thought out. Nothing seemed out of place.\n\nUnfortunately, the story was a bit bloated. There were several scenes that definitely could've been taken away to cut down on the runtime a bit.\n\nI don't wanna go into specifics for spoilers, but if you like Robert Eggers at his other works, you're gonna enjoy this film."", ""The film gives like a masterful blend of gothic elements and suspenseful storytelling, capturing the essence of both genres to create an immersive cinematic experience. It's exhilarating to witness throughout audiences that the movie delivers a series of unexpected thrills, maintaining a gripping pace that ensures viewers are constantly engaged. The symbolic interplay between dreams and reality adds a profound layer of depth, inviting audiences to decipher the underlying messages woven throughout the narrative. It's a testament to the filmmakers' craft when a movie can evoke such a strong sense of anticipation and curiosity, leaving fans of gothic and suspense genres thoroughly satisfied and for others a longing for more narrative. Warning there is some sexual deviance within the film so parental discretion is advised."", ""It's a Gothic horror masterpiece in my opinion. I'm seeing it immediately again. I felt literally every emotion. The acting was incredible. The cinematography was visceral. The costuming was incredible and from what my untrained eye saw fairly accurate to 1830s Germany/ Victorian fashion. At the very least it was a delight to look at. My jaw stayed dropped 90% of the movie. If you love horror, vampires or all things Gothic I heavily encourage you to see it. The best remake I've ever seen. Better than the original even. Lily depp, Nicolas hoult and Bill Skarsgard acted their hearts out. Honestly every single actor played their parts incredibly. I very rarely care about the humans in monster movies but I was invested in just about every character in this movie. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time."", 'This film is difficult for me to digest, for within all of horror literature/cinema, the cult of Dracula and Nosferatu hold a most special place in my heart.\n\nWhen I learned that Eggers would be directing this film, I was not at all surprised, for as much as I know this man, I knew that sooner or later his path would intersect with this cult tale. As if to remind me why I love him so much, Eggers has underlined what an important filmmaker he is for the century we live in by making a film so faithful to the cult, yet so different.\n\nYes, Eggers is as independent as can be, but this is a film adorned with fine craftsmanship that will show us in 24 frames per second how much he admires Murnau and Browning.\n\nEggers, whom we have seen tell stories in black and white contrast before, does not expend extra effort to frighten us with blood and gore in Nosferatu, and enchants us with a marvelous visuality in which blue, red, and black dance in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio.\n\nNosferatu was like visiting a Penny Dreadful exhibition at the Louvre Museum... As I said, it is difficult for someone like me to digest this film in one go, I will be watching it more than ten times in 2 different countries during its theatrical release...\n\nCurse it all, my hand is still trembling. The Dolby Atmos sound design is tremendous. To watch this film without a very good image and sound system would be a great disrespect to the artist.\n\nSkarsgård\'s Orlok imprints all the character\'s manipulative abilities onto the viewer\'s soul thanks to Eggers\'s choice of camera angles.\n\nIt did not catch the attention of anyone I watched it with, but Eggers\'s inclusion of Willem Dafoe (Prof. Albin Eberhart von Franz), with whom he has worked on films before, in the cast of the film was a marvelous reference to the film Shadow of the Vampire (2000), in which Willem Dafoe previously starred and which tells the backstory of the film Nosferatu (1922) (and in which Dafoe played the character of Max Schreck).\n\n""It is a black omen to journey in poor health. You will remain and well rest yourself.""', ""The cinematography is non pareil. A total feast for the eyes. But then, so are all of Eggers movies.\n\nBut the cinematogrphy doesn't justify the boooooring verbosity and poor plot of this turkey.\n\nBill Skarsgard's makeup and acting are fine. Willem Dafoe's acting is .....yawn.\n\nSimon McBurney as Knock is great. I would never have thought to cast him as such.

If you love vampires, gothic stories, and horror, you will too. If you don\'t understand how dark, gory, and sexual the original vampire stories are, particularly Dracula from which Nosferatu is taken, then don\'t go see it! Some people walked out of the theater, and most of the audience in my theater were asking ""wtf"" by the end of it, which I don\'t understand. This is not some new-age interpretation of sexy or superhero vampires. It is dark! It is gothic! It is disturbing! That is what vampire stories are supposed to be. Audiences are just so simple-minded these days.\n\nThis movie was the closest and most accurate adaptation of a true Dracula-inspired vampire story that cinema has produced in a very long time, if not the most. It capture the horror of the predator so deeply, and the cinematography and script completely engross you in the time period. The suspense and dread are constantly building.', 'Robert Eggers\' films often blend superb historical period detail with some level of suspense or terror, and his latest film ""Nosferatu"" is no exception. It\'s a remake of the classic German 1922 silent horror film, which I highly recommend to film lovers. Despite not containing dialogue and being definitely not scary by today\'s standards, that film was still engaging, compelling, and well-made for its time, and it\'s probably aged as well as a film over a century old possibly could aspire to. With regards to Eggers\' previous films, I enjoyed ""The Witch"" and ""The Lighthouse"" but wasn\'t as fond of ""The Northman."" I thought that this film was fine, but it doesn\'t elevate itself above the original much.\n\nDespite my mixed feelings on the film overall, absolutely no one can deny that Eggers is an excellent craftsman at creating detailed period worlds. The production design and cinematography of 19th-century Germany are impeccable, as is the score, costume design, and editing. He knows how to create an excellent sense of atmosphere in his films, and while the film isn\'t that scary, he still ensures there is a general atmosphere of moodiness and impending dread. From those perspectives, the film is most certainly well-made. But unfortunately, the film\'s story doesn\'t feel any more unique, any more profound, or any more interesting than the 1922 original film. The characters aren\'t especially well-developed, and Eggers\' juxtaposition of more serious lead performances (Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp) with more campy supporting performances (Williem Dafoe, and to a lesser degree Emma Corrin and Aaron Taylor-Johnson) can sometimes come off as uneven or even a bit superficial. The film\'s runtime occasionally drags and feels a bit ""been there, done that."" Ultimately, while I admire the superb aesthetics of this remake, I prefer the 1922 original and wish Eggers had done something to elevate its story and characters a bit. 6/10.', 'Well the end of the year is finally coming to an end of the era, first off Merry Christmas to you all, second I got back from a pack large house of NOSFERATU which it did won 50+ nominations and after seeing this, shocked on how many people attended to this last film phenomenon that has the Robert Eggers style to his chemistry. The Witch was a dark folk tale, THE LIGHTHOUSE has that England accent dated back to the late 19th century, THE NORTHMAN was dated back in the 18th century which is a dark folk medieval Scandinavian legend. Now NOSFERATU is early on the 19th century, dated back to 1830\'s. NOSFERATU had a nomination for best costume design, best cinematography, best director and best horror and thriller. One major problem is that I wish it was it had a IMAX exclusive and guess what the IMAX seats are for? Yep Mufasa which is a Disney Live Action film, why would NOSFERATU couldn\'t be squeeze in the IMAX version, now we have to be in a theater with not dolby surroundings but just standard surround sound audio, thats just ridiculous. By 2025 Oscar\'s and Academy Awards, then will wait till then. In the meantime, NOSFERATU has that dark Gothic horror (almost black and white picture) Eggers Thanked SpongeBob as an introduction to younger audiences dated back to the early 2000\'s and he and Squidward saids ""NOSFERATU.""', ""This movie was just okay. Some of the scenes were definitely NOT needed and really didn't add much to the story. I didn't think it was slow, if you have seen other versions or telling of this story than you know they're all 'slow' I thought the acting was really good, but I DEFINITELY prefer the version with Gary Oldman from the 90s. I just feel like it was a better version of the story without all the sex scenes (there were some, but not like this movie) I feel like I could've waited until this came out on streaming to watch it rather than spend the money. But- it was still entertaining, Willam DaFoe is always worth the watch."", ""While the visuals, lighting and atmosphere are expertly crafted as per Egger's typical modus operandi, the film felt like a major let down compared to his previous works. The characters felt shallowly written and clichéd, and as such it felt like there were no stakes because you simply weren't invested in the story itself. It wasn't compelling, nor was it horrifying.\n\nThe other major issue was the pacing. The film could have retained some much needed suspense or atmosphere, but seemed more aroused to blast loud noises, jump scare and show us the monster at every chance it could. Ultimately I left the cinema rather bored.\n\nI would still recommend watching it, but don't expect an experience akin to The Lighthouse or The Witch. The script is weaker, the characters are flat and the film relies too much on loud noises and creepy imagery, where proper pacing, better acting and thoughtful story telling should have been found."", 'Watched the new Robert Eggers ""Nosferatu"" on New Years Day. I loved it, but I also want to say that I\'d worked hard to keep my expectations low. Based on the trailers, I had feared that Eggers would deliver a conventionally-beautiful ""gothic period piece"" full of lovely visuals but lacking in heart. I feared a handsome but shallow film, essentially.\n\nOn the other hand, I was really HOPING that Eggers would deliver a version of the story which might answer my biggest complaints about the two previous versions. I\'d recently watched both earlier versions -- the 1922 F. W. Murnau original, and the 1979 Werner Herzog version. And hey, both films are worthwhile, and have myriad strengths by which to recommend them. But I felt like there was a major weakness common to both these earlier versions of the story, and it was simply this: Both films are extremely episodic, they have no regard for pacing, and the characters in both films frequently lack meaningful motivations for their actions.\n\nIt\'s not so surprising that the characters in the original silent film were paper-thin and sometimes acted in ways which were unbelievable. That was kind of how most movies were back then; the lack of sound fairly limited what could be established, character-wise, because all dialogue had to be displayed as title-cards. And so, a lot of the characters in the F. W. Murnau original behave in strange and rather inexplicable ways, leaving us to either decide that they\'re complete nincompoops, or to invent our own rationale for their behavior.\n\nHerzog\'s film had fewer excuses on that front, given advances in filmmaking grammar and technology -- and yet it still made many of the same mistakes. Herzog humanizes Nosferatu, turning him into an actual character with very relatable human fears, and that\'s certainly an interesting innovation. It\'s also nice how Herzog pivots entirely to Lucy\'s perspective for the last act of the film; he gives her much more meaningful screen-time, and succeeds in making her sacrifice at the end of the film feel more powerful as a result.\n\nBut Herzog\'s film drags glacially. And until that final act, his film still has trouble finding believable motivations for its characters, and the plot still seems built upon some inexplicable notions. For instance, isn\'t it weirdly convenient and kinda silly that the ol\' Count is looking to move-house, and then falls into deep fated love with the wife of his real-estate agent, based only on a tiny and blurry picture kept in a locket? Perhaps some people see in this ""the randomness of evil."" I see in it a poorly-established character motivation.\n\nWe also have the matter, in both earlier films, of Ellen\'s/Lucy\'s visions/fits/sleepwalking episodes. Ellen/Lucy is the wife of the real-estate agent -- the woman whom the vampire falls into lust with. The Murnau and Herzog films both suggest that Ellen/Lucy had a history of such episodes, before the vampire casts his spell over her. This history never proves important, other than to set her up as a character with a certain ""psychic sensitivity."" It\'s more of a plot-device -- in the sense that, once the vampire\'s spell is cast, it is as if the vampire is harnessing this weakness/sensitivity to commune with her.\n\nTo finally get back to the present: I was really kind of shocked and delighted by just how thoroughly the new Robert Eggers film remedies all of my problems with the previous versions. It\'s like the dude read my mind and delivered exactly what I wanted, only better.\n\nFirst off: Eggers BEGINS his film with a sequence which centers the entire story around Ellen/Lucy\'s experience. It certainly bucks convention for her to be the protagonist from the outset -- but there\'s a really good reason for that, and it\'s basically because she\'s the most interesting character; she has the most meaningful conflict.\n\nThat would have been true in any version of this film -- but here, that opening scene establishes a new context for her visions, and it makes her history relevant in ways that it never was in the Murnau or Herzog versions. It also, rather brilliantly, establishes a much more relevant and compelling REASON for WHY the vampire seeks to move to her town in the first place. And it does all of this without losing the scary implication that evil can act at random, selecting helpless targets who least deserve it.\n\nThat opening scene, and the context it establishes, is the first of several brilliant tweaks that Eggers brings to the material. Overall, it seems that from a storytelling perspective, his efforts have mostly been in the service of doing exactly what I had hoped he would do -- he brings a clarity of motivation to all of the characters, and a greater sense of visceral inevitability to the plot, all without abandoning the broad strokes and the most famous ""beats"" of the original two films.\n\nSo to explicitly compare the three, I\'d say this: While the first two versions of Nosferatu had lots of great ideas, and many spooky visuals, they were both marred by a rather episodic quality, some questionable pacing, and a lot of poorly-established character motivations. The new Eggers film delivers a version of the story which plays as a compelling and immersive drama, with characters whose motivations actually make sense, and a sense of pacing which draws us viscerally from one scene to the next. His film held me like a vice from first shot to last.\n\nEggers also gives us a visual sensibility, and a sound-design, which are far more crisply stylized than either of the previous versions. Sometimes when a film gets too stylized, it can lose something, can start to feel hermetically-sealed. But I think the approach here really works. I mean, it worked for me. Not only did I find this film FAR creepier than either previous version of this tale -- but I also thought that many of Eggers\'s audiovisual-design choices were quite meaningful.\n\nFor instance, in one of the beats that each version of the film hits, the young real-estate agent is met on a mountain-road by a mysterious carriage sent by the Count. The carriage itself is, I think, meant to be sinister. The thought, I gather, is something about a man delivering himself naively into the embrace of evil. His entrance into the carriage is the fateful step, that step he cannot take back.\n\nIn the original version, Murnau did what he could to make the carriage, and Tom/John\'s ride within it, seem otherworldly. But you know, it was the early days of film, and the techniques he used have not withstood the test of time. To modern eyes, or at least to my eyes, that scene in the original plays as unintentionally comical.\n\nHerzog includes the carriage, but doesn\'t really do much with it. A carriage arrives, in the darkness, yes. But the carriage is baroquely ornate, not exactly ""foreboding"" -- and the driver seems friendly, and the music sounds hopeful, and the whole scene just doesn\'t play as tense or foreboding in the slightest. The beat is there, but it\'s not very effective except to say, ""And then John took a carriage to the castle.""\n\nEggers sets the scene at a moonlit crossroads in a dense alpine forest. First of all: The ""crossroads"" is a perfect idea. Where is the devil met? At a crossroads, of course -- where one is invited down the wrong path. And how does the devil arrive? Well, in this Eggers telling: Silently. The carriage glides supernaturally down the road, almost without sound. The door to the carriage opens by some unseen hand. Tom Hutter finds himself pulled inside, as if entranced, as if lifted and carried. Just a pitch-perfect way to handle that scene. Just evocative in all the right ways.\n\nAnd man, there\'s just beat after beat that Eggers handles with that kind of superb attention to detail. He just finds ways of making all the visuals and sound work perfectly for the story, while also speaking beyond the story, toward the mythological.\n\nI\'ll end my review here because I could go on, but that\'s pretty much everything I wanted to say. I felt like the Robert Eggers version of ""Nosferatu"" wildly exceeded my expectations, and I haven\'t stopped thinking about it since I saw it.\n\nAh, but I guess there\'s one other thing you probably want to know. Would I call the film ""scary?"" This is a question which does not matter to me. I have watched and loved plenty of horror-films which I wouldn\'t call ""scary."" The word itself is a trap, because not everyone defines ""scary"" the same way. What I will say is this: the Eggers version of ""Nosferatu"" DEEPLY creeped me out, and I can\'t say that about either of the previous versions. This film filled me with so much dread and anxiety that there were times I wished I could pause the movie and go do something else for awhile. I was quite unsettled by it. But I was also dealing with some emotional stuff before I watched it, and that has its own influence. I will happily watch this movie again -- but probably not real soon.', ""Eggers's Nosferatu embodies the timeless brilliance that modern filmmakers often delude themselves into believing they have outgrown. Stripped of the overwrought theatrics emblematic of James Wan's style, it captures the pure essence of human nature. The entire cast delivered naturally flawless performances, with the slight exception of the nepo-baby actress, but even masterpieces are bound to have their imperfections. With Dafoe and Hoult commanding the screen so effortlessly, I find myself beginning to hold Eggers in the same high regard as Yorgos Lanthimos. It would be absurd to even compare Megalopolis-don't make me laugh."", 'Robert Eggers has crafted a stunning, mesmerizing gothic horror that leaves you utterly breathless with its beauty and mastery. Every scene is meticulously crafted with such care and detail that this remake stands as one of the finest films I\'ve ever seen.\n\nHaving grown up on Hammer Horror and Christopher Lee\'s Dracula films, Eggers\' Nosferatu felt like my childhood dreams brought vividly to life. From the stellar acting to the gothic, suspenseful atmosphere full of relentless dread and unease, to the sharp writing and breathtaking cinematography, every element of this movie is near perfect.\n\nSpecial mention must go to Lily-Rose Depp, who delivers an absolutely mesmerizing performance-she is simply extraordinary. From Nell Tiger Free in First Omen to Naomi Scott in Smile 2, and now Lily-Rose Depp, we\'ve witnessed some truly powerhouse, masterful performances in recent horror films.\n\nVery few movies today evoke that feeling of pure ""cinema,"" but Nosferatu is undeniably one of them-a gorgeous, mad masterpiece.\n\nI loved it!', ""The movie was great, however I feel like Lily-Rose was trying TOO HARD to prove herself. Her acting in this film was over the top. Never thought I'd say that, but she was much. It gave Showgirls Elizabeth Berkeley vibes. Bill Skarsgard is just so good at his craft. He's perfected the villain. His intense stare when you could see his face, imposing height, and brings his version of that character is amazing. Nicolas Hoult is great too. His eyes are the actors, intense. Aaron-Taylor Johnson's character seemed a little comedic. Not sure if that was the intent. Lily-Rose should have dialed it back some."", ""I thought this film would be much more intense and way scarier...it was just decent...The jump scares all failed and the Nosferatu makeup failed, I was waiting for Nosferatu to show up but realized the tall dude with the mustache was him...he looked like Stone cold steve austin or Freddie Mercury ...Jump scares are cheap scares but even in this film they were VERY CHEAP and didn't work, I loved the visuals and settings, but the Nosferatu himself didn't work for me. He was not scary. The Last Voyage of the Demeter was a bit better but no one probably cares lol. Also the original Nosferatu design is so much scarier...was hoping we would get that kind of makeup along with a twist...we didn't get much at all...will never rewatch this film again sadly. Decent for a 1st time watch...Loved the Lighthouse, liked the VVITCH...sadly this one let me down."", 'What Works\n\nAtmospheric Direction: The movie excels in creating an eerie, gothic atmosphere. It feels like stepping into a painting of terror and melancholy, which is sure to captivate fans of slow-burn horror.\n\nExceptional Performances: The lead actors breathe new life into the iconic characters, especially Nosferatu himself, who is as unsettling as he is tragic. BILL RULES! Dafoe is exceptional as always.\n\nVisual Mastery: The cinematography is stunning, blending chiaroscuro lighting with modern visual effects to retain the essence of the original while offering something fresh.\n\nUnique Storytelling: Director Robert Eggers crafts a narrative that\'s not just a horror tale but also a meditation on isolation, obsession, and humanity\'s darker sides.\n\nWhat Might Divide Audiences\n\nPacing: The deliberate, slow pace of the film amplifies tension for some but may feel sluggish or overly indulgent for others.\n\nArt-House Approach: Fans of traditional horror might find its avant-garde style and symbolic depth too esoteric.\n\nTone and Mood: The bleakness and lack of typical jump-scare moments may alienate those seeking a more conventional horror experience.\n\nFinal Take ""Nosferatu"" is a cinematic for those who appreciate atmospheric, thought-provoking horror. It\'s a film that rewards patience and a love for the macabre. However, its NICHE appeal means it\'s not a crowd-pleaser in the traditional sense. EVEN though this is Eggers most general audience appealing movie, If you\'re a fan of artistic storytelling and gothic horror, it\'s a must-watch. Otherwise, it might not be your cup of blood.', ""I had high hopes as I'm a fan of The Witch and The Lighthouse, but this movie was such a letdown. A few (very few) jump-scares aside, this movie did not provide a sense of fear, tension or dread. The use of dark lighting was overused and frustrating. The repeated scenes of characters' screaming fits of hysteria - ineffective and increasingly annoying. Worst of all, Orlok himself was simply not scary. As a child, I remember seeing clips from the original Nosferatu and finding it terrifying... in particular, Orlok's face, and the searing, iconic mage of his shadow walking up the stairs. But Eggers dropped the ball on this one. Skarsgard was made up big and ugly, yes, but fingernails aside, his certainly will not go down as one of the more frightening iterations of Dracula."", ""I had a lot of expectations for this one, i've been a fan of Eggers since his first movie : The witch. He made me love him even more with the outstanding : The Lighthouse, and really appreciated The northman. Concerning his last picture : Nosferatu, i can't deny that it's beautifully shot, great atmosphere, very clever editing, and overall good performances. However, why do i feel like there was absolutely no surprises ? Everything is so predictable from start to finish... The storytelling is pretty flat and doesn't give any sense of suspense unfortunately.\n\nThere is no way of getting attached to any of the characters who spend most of the time crying and moaning throughout the film. As i said before, the aesthetic of the movie is fabulous, but it's clearly not enough !! The ending sequence had me walking out laughing... And I don't think that was the point of the ending unfortunately, just felt like a soulless film to be honest, don't really get the point of it. Very disappointed, what a shame."", ""Nosferatu is an absolute beast of a movie. It has strong themes and technically near perfect.\n\nThe story is something I wouldn't think I like, but the strong themes make me enjoy it as well. The theme of evil trying to survive, presenting itself as attractive is something I loved. Ellen knew what she had done was bad, while she still had enjoyed it. My favourite character was Professor Eberhart, because he immediately understood what was going on, I love these kind of characters. The dialogues sometimes feel too much.\n\nThis is the first movie where I noticed several scene transformations. The editing was beautiful. The pacing isn't perfect though, I think the movie could've been a little shorter. The cinematography is award-worthy. Slowly moving, revealing camera all the time. Give me more of that. The lighting is the best I have ever noticed. The cast is amazing, Lily-Rose Depp was obviously the best, but Willem Dafoe is a powerhouse. He has a presence no one else does and he gave my favourite performance. The sets also looked amazing, I genuinely don't know how much they relied on CGI. The practical effects looked great. Robert Eggers is a master at crafting a film, I'm looking forward to watching his other films.\n\nNosferatu is damn good movie. The best shot movie of the year and the best lighting I have ever seen."", ""It's amazing when a movie positively surprises you even though you already expected it to be good. Nosferatu is pretty much everything i hope it would be, and a bit better! It's the most narratively conventional movie that Eggers has done so far, wich was totally expected since it's basically a remake, but he adds a modern spin and edge to it that makes this version just as interesting and compelling as the original one. The movie is so good that not even the loud and stupid group of teenage girls sitting in the row behind me could ruin the experience. Add to that the fat and rude guy in the chair next to me... Not even those things ruined the mood that the movie put me in. It's not a perfect film, it starts to drag a bit after Thomas leaves Orlock's castle, and some of the supporting characters needed more development, but apart from that, Nosferatu is an effective ghotic horror that features some great performances, striking imagery, and a dark atmosphere that lingers with you long after you've watched it."", ""I have seen many reviews disregarding this movie, I left feeling the exact opposite. The performances were grand, the story grim, and the cinematography perfect. It was a GREAT MOVIE. Depp was stellar in her portrayal. She was terrifyingly good. All actors did an incredible job. If you don't have an attention span, maybe this movie isn't for you but I didn't think it was long, or drug on. I viewed it as a great play, with many different acts. Turing from horror to supernatural to even some action. All I can say is don't let any of the reviews make your judgements for you, go see it yourself and you'll be pleased."", ""I read the first few wave of reviews and although I had high hopes, some negative reviews really curbed my expectations. Now a few hours after seeing and digesting the film I got to say this movie was really well done. The negatives others had about the movie didn't resonate with me at all. I felt like this movie is a real gem that should be enjoyed in the theater. The cinematography is the precipice and the actors did an incredible job. You feel the emotions and strife in every scene. The movie score is fantastic as well. As a vampire movie lover, Nosferatu 2024 has made its mark as a must see. Very well done!"", ""Went into this super excited. From the first time you saw Orlok's moustache, all I could think of was Jim Carrey's doctor Robotnik, and I haven't even seen any of the Sonic movies. I was having a good time up to that point.\n\nI saw this with 3 other people and I came out of it with the most favourable opinion. Visually, it leaned hard on Sleepy Hollow and the Corpse Bride. There were scenes where Ellen looked almost identical to Victoria. Story telling-wise it fell short of both. The timeline was tricky to follow. (How do you get 3 custom coffins in 2 hours in the 1830's?)and characters not aging etc. Parts felt edgy for the sake of being edgy. I dunno. It had some visual striking moments and some moments with good performances but overall, disappointing."", 'No spoilers in saying Nosferatu is an appropriately dark, gothic, gorgeously grotesque, vampyre horror film.\n\nI would recommend not being in a theater with a lot of distracting food service. I saw the 35 mm at Alamo Drafthouse and would have preferred not seeing people walking back and forth like they do there.\n\nThe Northman, The Lighthouse, The Witch are all primers for the Eggers technique.\n\nI was fascinated by the prosthetics. The large, looming physicality of the count is felt in the sound and visual effects.\n\nMinimally lit using candles, lanterns and natural light. The camera lingers for all the special moments and sometimes I wanted more time to observe.\n\nThe actor who plays Knock (the ""Renfield"" to Orlok) is Simon McBurney. This is a character he probably waited his whole life to play.\n\nCan\'t mistake Lily-Rose Depp. She looks like both of her parents.\n\n🐀', ""Robert Eggers' 'Nosferatu' is the second remake of F. W. Murnau's famous film made over 100 years ago. I haven't counted a sequel, a CGI remix of the original film, musicals or cartoons inspired by the same character. What could a film about Nosferatu bring in 2024? Why yet another remake of a silent film masterpiece, especially after the first remake was directed by Werner Herzog? I entered the cinema hoping that Robert Eggers (who also wrote the screenplay alongside Bram Stoker and the author of Murnau's film) would have convincing answers. My expectations were only partially met.\n\nEggers' version follows the narrative line of Murnau's film quite faithfully. Secondary characters are added and certain situations are developed, including a scene at the Transylvanian inn where the young real estate agent Thomas Hutter stops, which gives the opportunity to hear Romanian spoken. The main change, however, is the character of Professor Albin Aberhart von Franz, a doctor and expert in alchemy, magic and other esoteric disciplines. Played by Willem Dafoe, one of those actors who, for me, can do no wrong, he becomes the key to the plot, the one who discovers the dark mystery of the mysterious illness of Ellen Hutter, the main heroine, and the remedy that will break the curse and stop the plague that had struck the imaginary German city where the story begins and ends. This remedy, however, involves a supreme personal sacrifice, which here receives a sexualized version, because, well, we are in the 21st century. The images of the city hit by the plague resonate with contemporary anxieties related to pandemics, even if the vehicle of global propagation in the film - a sailing ship at sea - is not plausible to have been used from landlocked Transylvania.\n\nI like Eggers' style, creativity, ambition and extremism. That does not mean that he succeeds in everything he does, in my opinion. The formidable 'The Lighthouse' was followed by 'The Northman', which was a horrible experience for me. Now, with this remake of 'Nosferatu', the disappointment is only partial. The idea of female sacrifice is the central axis of the plot, helped by the very interesting interpretation of Lily-Rose Depp, who alternates the intensity of feelings with the lethargy of moments of anguish and depression. I'm not so convinced that the exaggerated convulsions to which the character (and the actress) are subjected were appropriate, but I understand the idea of a failed exorcism. In general, in Eggers' world, the premises include the acceptance of magic, esoteric sciences and everything that Gothic novels bring amplified with cinematic horror means. The visual style of his films is already recognizable, the result of his continuous collaboration with the cinematographer Jarin Blaschke. We already know that an Eggers film has a high chance of including cold, rain and snow, dark colors, many night scenes lit by torches. Added to these are the special effects - some simple and expressive (Nosferatu's hands imported from Murnau), others amplified by digital effects such as the physiognomy and body of Count Orlok, played with courage and aplomb by Bill Skarsgård. The problem is that all these elements can be appreciated individually, but they do not connect in a story that brings something new (especially for those who have seen Murnau's film) or creates emotion. Even the character of Ellen failed to gain my empathy. For me, this version of 'Nosferatu' is yet another rewriting of a legend that had me glued to my seat the first time I saw it, but which no longer has the same effect on the third. That does not mean that I will not wait for the next Robert Eggers film and will not seek to see it as soon as it is available. With the same high expectations."", ""That was a great fantastic ghotic horror movie!!!\n\nI just saw nosferatu and it was great, the build up was really tense and the story was disturbing and beautiful.\n\nBill skarsgard was amazing as Nosferatu you don't even recognize him in this role if someone told me it was bill skarsgard i wouldn't believed them.\n\nThe overall cast did a great job specially willem dafoe, lilly depp , and Emma corrin.\n\nThe cinematography and the music were stunning.\n\nThe movie really gives you the chills.\n\nI really liked atmosphere this movie gives, if you a horror fan you definitely gonna like this movie.\n\nThe only thing that could have been better is Aaron Taylor Johnson his lines.\n\nThis was great horror Christmas movie and a movie you that should definitely watch in theaters."", ""I usually love Robert Eggers' work - his films have this unique ability to pull you into eerie, unsettling worlds that linger with you long after the movie has finished. But his take on Nosferatu just didn't land for me.\n\nThe pacing was painfully slow, to the point where it felt like it was dragging for the sake of atmosphere rather than tension. And while I can appreciate deliberate storytelling, this just felt uninspiring, like it was going through the motions without that signature spark Eggers usually brings to his projects.\n\nTo make matters worse, I couldn't stop seeing Dr. Robotnik from Sonic the Hedgehog every time Nosferatu was on screen. It's probably not fair to the film, but the resemblance was so distracting that I found myself more amused than unsettled.\n\nUltimately, Nosferatu lacked the sharp, visceral energy that made Eggers' previous work so compelling. Instead of feeling haunted, I left the theater feeling underwhelmed."", ""As of this Christmas day, horror filmmaker Robert Eggers has released his own retelling of the iconic Dracula knockoff, Nosferatu. Marking the second theatrically released remake of F. W. Murnau's gothic horror classic, the film has marked a return to form for Eggers in bringing the source material into the 21st century. It appears his efforts have paid off as the film has garnered critical acclaim for its passionate recreation of the gothic nightmare, especially following its world premiere in Berlin earlier this month. So looking at the film on its own merit, how well does it come off in a modern lense?\n\nMuch like the original film, Eggers' feature follows a real estate salesman named Thomas Hutter, who is tasked with securing residence for wealthy Transylvanian Count Orlok, only to discover that the vampiric count is infatuated with his wife Ellen. In regards to how the story is told, a lot of emphasis is put on Orlok's desire towards Ellen and destroying anyone and anything in his path. Many of the terrifying sequences are carried through strikingly dark shot composition and spine tingling music, allowing the mere presence of Orlok, the black plague he unleashes in Germany, and those who fear him to seep into one's soul. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke depicts a respectful homage towards 19th-century Romanticism, allowing the thrills to unfold amidst the erotic tension and body horror on display. In fact, the erotic elements feel more terrifying than the film's intended terror shown, which does make sense given how truly demonic Orlok's lust towards his prey is. Through these notable production qualities, the tale of Nosferatu has never felt this artistically frightening before.\n\nWith a strongly crafted feature comes a solid cast, and Bill Skarsgard nearly steals the show portraying Orlok in all his creepy alore. Seeing him interact with Nicholas Hoult as Thomas and Lily-Rose Depp as Ellen individually lends to some truly gut wrenching tension as he consumes their souls, allowing a lot of genuine fear to set in as the aforementioned characters lose their grip on reality. While Friedrich Harding has too obvious of a payoff, Aaron Taylor-Johnson elicates the right amount of blinded skepticism through stoic yet ruffled stubbornness. Emma Corrin portrays arguably the film's most sympathetic character in Friedrich's wife Anna, and any scene where she's by her children or Ellen could make one shed a tear in concern. Also, you can never go wrong with Willem Dafoe in any role he's in, as he brings the role of Prof. Albin Eberhart Von Franz to life with subtle devotion and intrinsic knowledge beyond the realm of organic science. One can't deny how talented Robert Eggers is to the point of instilling such devoted trust in his cast for this kind of movie.\n\nBrilliantly crafted and acted as it is gothically haunting, Robert Eggers' remake of Nosferatu is a spellbinding horror that pays its deepest respect towards the original German expressionist film and offers a repulsively beautiful look into the titular character. Now that the film has been unleashed for the world to see, I cannot recommend it enough for horror fans, Nosferatu enthusiasts and the general public alike. Time will surely tell what Eggers' next project will entail, but if this passion project of his has proven anything, it's that his divine admiration towards cinematic horror will be unlike anything else out there."", ""The story of Nosferatu isn't going to be original, especially if you are familiar with the lore/Bram Stoker's Dracula. What is original is the vision this film is retold in. It's a throw back to when films created atmosphere and you don't know what is going to happen.\n\nThe acting is top knotch and cinematography and score are peerless. Those looking for a fast food horror film will be disappointed, but if you want something with gothic substance and shadowy bleakness, this retelling is for you. Possibly my favorite version of a Wallachian Warlord turned Vampire.\n\nThe middle does drag a slight bit, which is why I gave it an 8, but it's a wonderful film made for those that crave more from their movies."", 'Honestly, reading through the reviews I was shocked to see how so many found this movie ""boring"" to ""walking out"", as the atmosphere and buildup of this film is one of the best in modern horror to date. So many times the true nature of the horror genre is bled out through useless jump scares, an over abundance of gore for shock value, or with ""supernatural"" elements that are just laughable. Cut to 2024 Nosferatu and you\'ll understand what a horror movie should be. The eerie suspense, the constant feeling of dread, and the overwhelming sense of Orlock stalking from the shadows- all of this is just the sprinkles on top of the Great-Movie-Sunday. The cinematography was beautiful, the set was astonishing considering the budget used, and the fantastic use of negative space and subtle hints in the backgrounds of scenes make for a constant feeling of someone stalking from the shadows beyond. This movie is not only a fantastic example of what makes a horror film great, but specifically finds the scariest and most horrifying aspects of the Vampire genre and combines them with a world class example of utilizing ""the unknown"" to bring forth dread and terror. Wonderful. I can\'t wait to see more from Eggers after this incredible adaptation- I truly believe this will be viewed as one of the Dracula greats.', '8.0/10 (Highly Recommend)\n\nEvery year on my birthday I go see a movie in theatres because it\'s a failsafe way for me to actually enjoy myself. This year\'s movie was no exception. While I really had no clue on what to expect from ""Nosferatu"" I wasn\'t left wanting.\n\nI feel it has a good story. The setting is introduce well though slightly confusing. The climax and ending are pleasing though kind of expected. The cinematography is fantastic. I enjoyed the way moments were captured and it pulls you in for the scares even though they were anticipated.\n\nThe acting is good and may or may not make you feel at unease for certain moments. The swing of emotions is definitely unsettling at times. Bill Skarsgard was good but off for me. I couldn\'t unsee him as Pennywise, but the character he plays is definitely not a character I would want to come across in real life.\n\nOverall, this movie is a great 21st century film that feels like an early movies horror like 1920s/30s-1950s-ish. It definitely worth seeing in theatres. It\'s gruesome, and horrifying even though certain moments are to be expected. The era is captured quite well, and the darkness of the tale is unsettling. I definitely feel this movie has multiple watches in it, but over the course of a year instead of months or days. The only true downside was some of the speaking parts. I couldn\'t understand what was being said. All in all it was a great birthday movie and I\'m glad I saw it.\n\nThat\'s it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!', ""I would have liked the movie better had Lilly Rose Depp not been the lead female. She has a dead eyed look to her and it seemed that is how she appeared for the whole of the movie. She is almost emotionless. Is she acting or is that just her face? I can't tell anymore. I would have liked to see her and Emma swap roles.\n\nThe plot and filmography was enjoyable. The male actors were good in their roles. Willem DaFoe was magnificent. Once again Bill Skaarsgard is able to transform into something unrecognizable and nail it, which I did not expect. There wasn't a lot of depth to some characters. I'd have like more of a back story to Ellen and Thomas."", ""Perhaps it was because I have seen the silent film a few times, including just the other day in preparation to see this in the theater.\n\nI thought it was excellent. Broody, dark, well directed, filmed and cast. I didn't see a bad performance here. Simon Mcburney was perfect as Herr Knock.\n\nThis version sticks very close to the silent film. If I had any nit to pick, they didn't need such graphic special effects! They could have relied in the imaginations of the audience. All the places the silent film lacked, due to how early it was made, this delivers.\n\nI don't know what the reviews with lower ratings were expecting. Maybe they like everything explained in detail so they don't need to pay attention or think?\n\nMaybe they should watch or rewatch the original?\n\nIt's a triumph for all involved."", ""Lily Rose Depp offers an unforgettable performance and went to places I didn't know she was capable of. I felt moved by her devotion to the character. Skarsgard completely transforms with every villainous character he takes on, and he truly outdid himself as Count Orlok.\n\nSo many beautiful and creative shots, I tried to take in the stunning wardrobe and appreciate the dark and eerie set design while just in awe. The atmosphere and world created by Eggers was enough to keep me locked in for the entirety of the movie and when it ended I would have happily watched it from the beginning all over again.\n\nEverything I look for in a horror movie. No notes, simply Eggers best film yet."", ""I mean if you have read the book, or seen the first one, you kinda know what you are in for. This is not sparkle vampires playing baseball in the rain.\n\nThe visuals are amazing, and the acting is good as well. The story is the story. If you don't like gothic romance, don't watch it.\n\nAll in all, a decent movie, but one I'm already starting to forget less than an hour later. I don't see this movie being a classic, cult, or otherwise, however, if you have a couple of hours to kill, it is a decent way to spend it.\n\nTake it for what it is, and you will be fine. With this one, expectations are going to be key."", ""The story of Dracula/Nosferatu has been told enough times in the past with better acting, script, scares, scenery, atmosphere, and most importantly-- backstory!\n\nDespite the hype generated around this film, it was a disappointing, cliched train wreck imo. The much anticipated gothic setting, costume, lighting, and makeup were the only aspects to appreciate here. It also scored high on the revolting-meter, if that's your taste in merit.\n\nThere was nothing new in terms of re-telling the Bram Stoker story. In addition, it didn't follow logic-- for example: how can you bring someone from Transylvania to Germany via boat? I don't believe there's a sea separating the two.\n\nThe acting was melodramatic: exaggerated convulsing, crying, screaming, and moaning throughout the film. Yes we know, it's about carnal pleasures and nothing else.\n\nLily Depp has a boring, flat, permanently droopy-lidded on-screen presence without variation of mood. Her husband (Hoult) doesn't seem to care much about anything except saving himself and getting a quick one. Nosferatu has a hilariously over-the-top booming wheezing fake-accented voice and is not scary~ neither in his scurvy nakedness nor his bear-skin cloak. He has no character outside of being an irritable, tyrannical hermit with a Lorax mustache making raspy gurgling sounds. His creeping shadow-clawed hand and Latin whispering brought neither foreboding nor anticipation to scenes--having seen this visual repeated in previous films. The story and characters were predictable and one-dimensional-- I was hoping someone would crack a joke to turn it into a parody.\n\nThere's no big reveal about why the two main characters, who appear to have zero chemistry, fell in love in the first place, or an offer to tell the story from another interesting angle. Could Eggers not have found a good screenwriter instead of trying to do everything himself?\n\nI found Nosferatu to be an unconvincing and shallow rendition of an iconic love story.\n\nThe only merit that kept me from falling asleep during the 2 hours was the deafening sound effects of convulsing, screaming, wailing, blood-glugging, hooves pounding, wood creaking, stone crumbling, chains rattling, rats squealing, coffins and doors clanking open and shut, just to make sure I've got the full sensory vampire/gothic experience rammed into my brain."", ""The film is beautiful and immersive. Pacing is a bit of an issue, but I think most of Eggars films start slow for world building and move quickly toward the end. Fundamentally, the film isn't about logic, it's about old magic. Not everything is understood and there's a lot of things left unsaid because it doesn't matter why they happen, what matters is how it make you feel. Whether you like the film or not will depend on how you feel about this kind of story telling. Modern stories rely on explaining the why. Eggars functions like many old stories and folk tales where the why isn't always important. Evil exists and its motivations aren't always clear."", ""If you aren't a fan of dramatic acting or historical pieces, then you will not like this movie. It's as simple as that. It's okay if you don't prefer these or other forms of traditional theatre, but you also shouldn't force yourself to enjoy them. Please don't watch this to save yourself from boredom.\n\nIf you are a fan of storylines, regardless of how they are depicted whether it be in a theatrical or contemporary sense, then you will likely appreciate the amount of effort put into making this an immersive and engaging film. You might enjoy the special effects and horror, and maybe the relationships between the characters. However, you would probably feel like this could have been better if it were more direct in its approach on the themes or dialogue. In other words, your lack of immersion will probably stop you from enjoying this movie.\n\nIf you are a fan of theatre, classic horror, a prolific reader, and/or an interest in cinematography, then you will love this film as much as I did. This is a masterpiece, and it will be a timeless example of modern horror. There is no modern rendition of this story that has captured the level of detail, characterization, and setting that this film has. This is the most accurate and impactful adaptation of both Dracula and Nosferatu. This is the type of media that defines the images around words such as vampire, and it will forever be one of the highest quality depictions of what that term used to be known for: evil incarnate."", ""I've been waiting to go see this at the theater since it started playing. After reading all the rave reviews on its cinematic beauty and such enthralling acting, I was super excited! Finally went today!! I was not disappointed! Knowing they shot scenes by mere candlelight was beautiful. The movie was very atmospheric, dark, and melancholy. Loved it!!\n\nI am rating this an 8 only because I found many parts in the movie to be too dark. I could not see what was going on. I found myself squinting many times to see. I do contribute part of this to the theater I watched it in. They have those dim lights so you can see where you're walking. It seemed as though they were interfering with the darkness of the movie and made it harder to see."", 'Yes. I love movies. No. I am nothing near a critic or reviewer. I was totally engrossed in this movie. The cinematography was fantastic. The acting was great, intentionally melodramatic. I was very much on the edge of my seat, anxious to see what would happen next and how it would be portrayed. A few ""gross"" scenes, though not a gross movie overall. I\'m not sure they completely stuck the landing. As the movie approaches the end, you know what is going to happen, waiting for the anticipated conclusion to... conclude. That is a bit of a break from my eager anticipation for what was coming next through most of the movie. A minor quibble with a fantastic movie. If you enjoy a slow burn or gothic horror, or just something a little different, go see it. You won\'t be sorry.', ""I was excited for this film. I was waiting for this film. I paused completing my Top Ten Best Films of 2024 List here on IMBD, until I saw this film. But here I am out of the theater, in the cold rain here in late December, a little disappointed and a little mystified.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nI love the 1922 and 1979 versions of the title character's films.\n\nLove them.\n\nHonestly, I think I love the '79 Werner Herzog version the most.\n\n(wince) Don't hate.\n\nBut I also love the work of Robert Eggers thus far.\n\nThe Lighthouse is his finest film, one of this century's greatest cinema efforts.\n\nThe Northman is his worst, but it's still not so bad. Just his worst.\n\nThis is close to his worst, but it's not.\n\nIt definitely pales to the two previous versions of Nosferatu that I cited from the last century.\n\nThis movie looks great.\n\nBut definitely not as gorgeous as the Werner Herzog film.\n\nAnd it's too long.\n\nAnd if I'm completely honest, there are many scenes with too much comedic potential, apparently, as people were actually audibly snickering in parts inside the theater.\n\nAnd the ending. That ending. The final scene, had some people in stitches.\n\nI almost started laughing because I could also see why they might find humor in that part.\n\nBut I also can see what the filmmaker was going for there.\n\nNot his worst film.\n\nNot the best version of Nosferatu.\n\nSadly, no longer eligible for my end of the year Best list.\n\nBut I'm still an admirer of the director's work and still look forward to his future projects."", ""I've waited so long for this movie, I watched the trailers and featurettes more than once. I told myself it was gonna be the best movie I saw in 2024. And let me just say that it's not often a movie meets and surpasses the hype you create for yourself.\n\nThis movie might be a masterpiece. I'm not too sure yet. I don't see much wrong with it.\n\nEvery single performance is outstanding!\n\nEggers once again nails the time period that he tackles in terms of costumes, environments, and dialogue.\n\nSpeaking of the dialogue, it was compelling throughout!\n\nThe lengths Bill Skarsgård went to portray this iconic character are truly admirable!\n\nNicholas Hoult needs to be in more movies!\n\nLily Rose Depp is absolutely insane!\n\nYou don't recognize Bill Skarsgård in any way whatsoever! His acting and makeup is that good!\n\nThe story is simple but intriguing. And it's elevated by the immaculate presentation, and the exploration of the respective themes.\n\nThe cinematography is gorgeous!\n\nThe musical score is haunting and powerful!\n\nOn a first watch, the pacing and editing feels off, but on a second watch you get a much better feel for them. At least that was the case for me.\n\nThe jumpscares in the movie are awesome!\n\nYou care about the characters facing Orlok! And the vampire himself is vile, disgusting, and intimidating. Take that, Stephanie!\n\nFor me it's one of those movies that gets better the more you think about it and the more times you watch it.\n\nThis is my second favorite movie from Eggers; behind The Lighthouse."", ""I had been excitedly anticipating this movie release since I read it about it last summer and whilst Robert Eggers' gothic romance cum horror has much to like it fell short of my heightened expectations.\n\nIt sticks pretty strictly to the well worn source story from Bram Stoker, not tempted to shape shift into some bonkers 21st century reinterpretation although it does move the action from Whitby in England to the German city of Wisberg.\n\nThose familiar with Eggers' masterpiece, The Lighthouse, will recognise its distinctive visual style, cinematography and production design (all night for day - or day for night - I don't know which it is - shooting that gives the sky, sea and city brooding foreboding). Each discipline could feature on the Oscar podium The monochrome look with occasional glimpses of duotone and even muted full colour is really quite beautiful.\n\nThere's one scene in particular when Thomas Hutter (the surveyor sent in search of the Dracula, Count Orlok - a weak link with his daft Transylvanian voice played by Bill Skargård) walks through a forest and rests at a crossroads. The black and white design embraces the forest and the gently snowing sky to silhouette our hero in a scene that is as much a work of art as you will see in any cinema this year - it ranks alongside the umbrella scene in Conclave for breathtaking visual artistry.\n\nBut the great news stops there. Aside from two very good Exorcist-lite possession scenes Lily-Rose Depp shows she has not inherited her father's acting skills, failing to muster real tears when required. She's passable, but no more. Nicholas Hoult huffs and puffs his way through his role suggesting he too is being asked a little too much by Eggers. There's a particularly am-dram moment when he is helped home to is house with a bit of limping that's straight out of your local church hall.\n\nAaron Taylor Johnson and Emma Corrin make a rather better fist of it as the married friends of the stricken Hardings who take them into their care (not that that ends well). And Willem Dafoe is pretty good value as the pantomime Prof. Albin Eberhart von Franz.\n\nThere's no real acting glory on show here and that rather lumbers a production that veers between high camp comedy (unintentionally) and reasonably intense jeopardy, but it's all a bit too long and the story too well known to really grab you by the cohonas.\n\nThe script's a bit cod in places and it works (I think as Stoker intended) more as a love story than a horror, so in that respect I suppose it succeeds more than it fails, but overall it's a bit of a disappointment. Its current score of 7.8 on IMBD mystifies me. It's certainly not that good."", ""Bill Skarsgård. The man you are. You better see yourself. You better trust yourself. And you better love yourself. You're the most talented actor in the whole world. I never doubted in you. You better never doubt in yourself. Will always love and respect you. You're a legend. And Lily-Rose Depp. Ma'am. I'm sorry. I wasn't familiar with you and your game. You're a legend too. The whole atmosphere of the movie was great. Cinematography was amazing. Willem perfect as always. I didn't like Nicholas Hoult that much. He was a little boring to me. Emma Corrin was brilliant. And Robert Eggers thanks again for another amazing movie!"", 'Idk... It felt promising with a high review score but this movie not only has a long screen time.. it also felt really long. This movie needs way more action, horror or just anything happening.\n\nThe start is decent, and i support directors with a story line build up.. but nothing else is happening. Even the evil guy is not that scary.. your kinda waiting for something but it never comes.\n\nI liked the time setting, the clothes, the way it is shot, the settings, but there is almost no story line to root for...i didnt feel any connection with any of the characters and because of this it became one long draggg...\n\nJust a 6 out of 10.

I thought it was great. It was brimming with heart, humour, and unforgettable songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The performances, especially from Dwayne Johnson as Maui and Auli i Cravalho as Moana, brought the characters to life in a way that felt fresh. Naturally, I was eager to see how a sequel would expand on the magic of the first movie. However, Moana 2, while enjoyable, doesn\'t quite recapture the same magic that made the original such a standout to me.\n\nOne of the biggest differences is in the music. With Miranda not returning to compose the songs, the sequel lacks the same level of musical brilliance. The new songs are decent and serviceable, but they don\'t have the catchy, emotionally resonant quality that made tracks like ""How Far I\'ll Go"" unforgettable. While the tunes in Moana 2 are pleasant, they fail to leave a lasting impression, making the musical aspect of the film feel less integral to the overall experience.\n\nThe story, too, feels like a weaker reflection of the original. Without delving into spoilers, the plot revisits themes and beats that feel overly familiar, which might leave fans unsatisfied. That said, the ending provides a heartfelt resolution that ties everything together in a satisfying way. Despite losing momentum in the middle, the final act does a great job of recapturing the story\'s emotional core, leaving me curious about what future adventures could look like.\n\nVisually, Moana 2 is a feast for the eyes. The animation remains top-tier, with solid visuals of the ocean, lush islands, and intricate details that make the world feel vibrant and alive. While the sequel doesn\'t quite reach the heights of the original in terms of story or music, it\'s still an enjoyable watch. For fans of the first film, it\'s worth checking out, even if it doesn\'t fully live up to its predecessor.', ""Moana 2 is an enjoyable sequel that I saw with my 4 and 8 year old daughters. I would recommend it for anyone with children as they are likely to be held for the duration and enjoy it.\n\nThe plot contains a lot of the same formula from the original movie (and Disney Princess animated features in general). This is not an issue, but for me what slightly disappoints is feeling shortchanged on story for what feels like the setting up of a third movie. On reflection (at the end) it feels like the slower character focussed aspects of the pre-adventure scenes (although good) are making up for the lack of material during the adventure. Compared to the original where the main antagonist had a fully realised character arc with a great twist, this one makes no contribution other than to pitch the next instalment. (There is a mid-credits scene so don't leave the cinema too early)\n\nThat being said there are no weak sequences, spectacle or character moments. I like how all the characters are used, particularly Moana's sweet little sister and all the relationships portrayed between people. The underlying message of togetherness and connecting people is very worthwhile. The new slant on the Kakamora is great.\n\nAs for the songs, I think, as always, it is a matter of taste, but for me they are not as memorable as the original.\n\nAs always with Disney the animation is incredible and the voice performances are great."", '""Moana 2"" has to be one of the most unexpected sequels in recent memory. It only came to my attention earlier this year when Disney announced they retooled a TV show that continues the original film\'s story into a theatrically released sequel. That\'s not even mentioning that they\'re releasing a live-action remake in 2026. The original ""Moana"" is an incredible film with spectacular voice acting from Auli\'i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson as Moana and Maui, dazzling animation, iconic songs in ""How Far I\'ll Go"" and ""You\'re Welcome,"" a legendary side-character in Schaffrillas...I mean Tamatoa and an engaging narrative. I was curious to see how a sequel would work, and after seeing it, I realized one hard truth: I\'m not the target audience.\n\nFor the positives, the voice acting is still remarkable, with Cravalho and Johnson again delivering energetic performances. Even though the story is not the strongest, which we\'ll get to, their work manages to get me somewhat invested.\n\nOf course, the animation is phenomenal. Disney films have always been known for their terrific animation, so it goes without saying that ""Moana 2"" is no different.\n\nWhile this film does not have as many memorable songs as the first, ""Can I Get A Chee Hoo?"" is hands down the standout. The song doesn\'t reach the heights of the powerful ""How Far I\'ll Go."" I don\'t think it will become as well-known as that song, but I enjoyed it.\n\nFor the remaining positives, three solid jokes landed here, its mid-credit scene was delightful, and the film is not that long. Sadly, negatives prevail and weigh down the experience - for me, at least.\n\nAlthough the runtime was short, I was bored even more than ""Gladiator II."" Many factors I\'ll mention possibly led to me thinking the movie was tedious, but its pacing left me dissatisfied.\n\nI also felt the villain fell flat, not as much as The Rock\'s other release this month, ""Red One."" I won\'t reveal who it is to avoid spoilers, but I didn\'t feel the threat from the film\'s antagonist.\n\nSo I don\'t over-critique it, I\'ll bring up one more point: I felt the narrative was weak. The setup of Moana going on an adventure to unite the islands seems simple at first, but the overall handling of that story comes across as convoluted. Said convolution leaves me with no investment in potentially emotional moments.\n\nOverall, ""Moana 2"" didn\'t work for me. I don\'t think it was unnecessary, but it didn\'t entirely justify its existence. It\'s simple and inoffensive yet oddly forgettable, so it\'s a fine enough trip to the movies. However, I\'m not recommending this in favor of ""Wicked"" for the Thanksgiving holiday season.\n\nTechnically, outside of issues with the story, the animation remains stunning, the voice acting is stellar, and the music is well-done yet average from my perspective, so the technical score is an 8/10.\n\nFor the enjoyment score, it is a standard sequel that has enjoyment but a standard sequel that is undeniably weaker than its counterpart. For me, the enjoyment score is a 5/10. Again, it is okay and will leave you interested to an extent, but I\'d recommend waiting until Disney+.', ""Saw this with my nephew today--we're each a fan of the first one for different reasons--and both of us were whelmed. It feels like they didn't push or take any creative risks with this one. Flows like a recycled, watered-down attempt to replicate what the first movie captured so effortlessly. The emotional core is painfully missing with this one. None of the musical numbers have you at the edge of your seat like How Far I'll Go, or choking up like the Song of the Ancestors. It's beautiful enough to look at, but without a good story to ground it, it makes sense that the characters, the music and the overall experience falter. It was still as good a time as many animated films I've seen, don't get me wrong, but it pales in comparison to its predecessor."", ""Giving this an 8/10 rating\n\nNot as good as the first film, but still, it has magic and adventure and lots of fun, and the animation is just wonderful. The firm is set well after the events that have changed Moana's destiny in the last film, and leads firmly into where she and here people must go next.\n\nThankfully, even with a nice runtime, this is not rushed, the new cast gets used good and proper, the songs are snappy and fit well, and yes Dwayne Johnson does sing too, and has settled int well for voice work so expect more. Good that Aull'i Carvalho is back as Moana, and really runs with it.\n\nYou have three writers and directors working on this, sounds chaotic, but it works out just fine, and does not feel episodic, the ocean and sea life is never dull looking, and the whole soundtrack fits in and not in the way as are the songs, this is a very good sequel, even if I didn't want one, the story has plenty of room. Just have to wait and see how this performs in the coming weeks of December, now.\n\nA great animated Disney film that has noting political or stupid messaging in it, pure entertainment and a one for IMAX if you can catch it there. Happy to see this picture in the cinema."", ""Visually, the movie was super beautiful with stunning animations to rival the previous movie. There are lots of funny call backs, and fun new characters, but the story is very formulaic. It's the same movie again with more bells and whistles and worse music. The music is a major let down. The fact they didn't have Lin Manuel Miranda really showed in the music. You're welcome was written perfectly for Dwayne Johnson but this time around, his lack of singing skills really show.\n\nI think kids will love this movie, with the cute characters and fun call backs. All the new characters open up more merchandising opportunities of course.\n\nFrozen 1 and 2 were so uniquely different yet such strong movies all around, but I find Moana 2 is just a repeat of the same story. I had higher hopes!"", 'Let\'s face it. The first Moana was amazing. Great soundtrack, great characters, great character arcs, and it was fun for the whole family. It was one of those movies that didn\'t need a sequel, because it was just perfect.\n\nUnfortunately, I can\'t say the same about its follow-up.\n\nMoana 2 felt soulless. It felt as if there was no heart behind it, unlike its predecessor. Each song that was sung (except for 1 or 2) wasn\'t that great. They weren\'t catchy, and didn\'t make me excited for what was about to happen!\n\nAnd the side characters...where do I begin?\n\nI couldn\'t tell you their names, even if I tried. They felt unnecessary throughout the movie except in very few scenes. It was just all so forced. We\'re given basic information about them and that\'s it. They don\'t really have any character development, and if they do, I don\'t feel like I know them well enough to care.\n\nThere are also some plot holes. There is a scene (and to avoid spoilers I will be as vague as possible) where we\'re introduced to a character who has been trapped by the ""villain"" of the film. (Why I have quotes around villain, I\'ll get back to later on.) After her 5 minute introduction, she is left behind and we never find out what happens to her, even after the defeat of the villain.\n\nTo get to my point on the villain, he was barely introduced. All we get told as an audience is that he\'s a power hungry god and that\'s it. We get barely any exposition, and the final battle is so fast. It felt like so much build up for nothing.\n\nNot a lot felt like it changed for Moana and her character by the end of the film. The stakes just barely felt like they were there.\n\nWhich also reminds me, the pacing for the movie was very off. Some scenes felt so fast while others took their time, and it gave me a weird feeling of not caring as much as the first film, although I wanted to care.\n\nAll in all, it\'s not the worst film ever. It\'s a family flick, that your kids will probably enjoy, but for me personally, it\'s definitely not one that I\'d watch more than once.', ""Compared to the first film, I would say it falls short, it is very difficult to surpass the standards that were set with the first release. The film was very enjoyable, there are 1 or 2 songs that were really good and the plot follows very well the narrative line that was proposed to us at the end of the previous film. I really appreciate that it paved the way for a sequel. Dspite that, it feels like the plot, especially at the beginning of the movie, was forced to pave the way for what would happen, making it very predictable, therefore it was difficult to get emotional. Personally, I think the film deserved a little more time to study the script and the characters. Many things feel out of place. Even though it has its small flaws, the movie is really good, the graphics are beautiful, the audiovisual effects give you goosebumps and you really get fond of the protagonist. Therefore I highly recommend watching this movie and make sure to watch it with headphones if you're going to do it at home, because it will greatly improve the experience. I will be waiting for a new release, as long as they take their due time to make the sequel since it is preferable to wait for the Moana 3 experience to be the best they could have done."", ""Moana 2 argues that she has to stop playing it safe and go off the beaten track only to then do the exact opposite as it copies the plot of the original just with greater scale and weaker everything else. Its origins as a TV show are definitely felt in the very choppy first act where no scene is allowed to last but it thankfully finds a better rhythm afterwards as it actually begins to feel like a film and then comes together nicely in the third act.\n\nAuli'i Cravalho gives it her all as Moana again, bringing as much emotion as possible to her new songs and every scene with Khaleesi Lambert-Tsud as her adorable younger sister is heartwarming to counterbalance the fact her journey is so much weaker here. Her new crew are mildly annoying even if they all find their purpose by the end and it needed way more of Awhimai Fraser. Dwayne Johnson is still charming as Maui but all the flaws and vulnerability have sadly gone.\n\nAfter the shaky start, directors David G. Derrick Jr., Jason Hand, and Dana Ledoux Miller make sure the film feels epic enough to warrant a cinematic release and the visuals during the musical numbers are suitably inventive. The animation is the one aspect that comes close to the original thanks to its stunning detail and vibrancy from beginning to end. The new songs don't come close to the quality of their predecessors and the score is only memorable when reusing previous work."", 'This movie was pretty bad. I was bored from start to finish. It felt like somebody wanted to make a sequel but wasn\'t clever enough to come up with one so they decided to remake the first one only worse. Adding more characters and braindead animals doesn\'t make it different or better. The story made no sense this time around, there wasn\'t really a villain and the purpose of the journey wasn\'t exactly clear. Overall, very weak and convoluted story with terrible songs, terrible writing, boring characters, unfunny humor and dull. The visuals were geat though. Except for Maui. It seems unnecessary to make him as ugly as they do. It\'s pretty excessive. It\'s like they were designing the character and somebody kept barging in and saying ""nope, not ugly enough. Keep trying"".', 'Moana 2 takes us back to the ocean and gives us another exciting chapter in her journey. The visuals are stunning, the story is okay solid (U\'LL LOVED THE LAST 20 MINUTES), and there are plenty of fun, heartwarming moments. But let\'s be honest-the music just doesn\'t hit the same way it did in the first movie.\n\nIn the original Moana, Lin gave us absolute bangers like ""Where You Are"" and ""You\'re Welcome."" Those songs weren\'t just good-they were unforgettable. They added so much life to the movie and stuck in your head (in the best way). But in Moana 2, the songs feel... fine? They\'re okay, but there\'s no wow factor, no song that makes you want to immediately add it to your playlist (except for Beyond 😉).\n\nStill, it\'s hard not to miss the kind of music that made the first Moana so special. If you\'re a fan of the first movie, you\'ll probably enjoy this one too, but you might find yourself wishing for just one more Lin-Manuel masterpiece to hum along to.', ""An unmemorable movie that represents the current state of Disney. It started out as a Disney+ show and definitely feels like a pointless side quest made to add content.\n\nMoana has no arc and there is nothing new with her. She already achieved her goal in the first film and there's little go forward with. Her plot is about finding other people, but there's no reason for her. She's lacking nothing, beloved by all, and gets everything her way already. There's no reason to root for her.\n\nMaui also hasn't changed. He's still the same smarmy guy from the start of the first, basically undermining any meaningful development that could have been had following his terrific arc last movie. The movie does lighten up when he has friendly banter with Moana, but they're away from each other so much it's hard to care.\n\nThe other new characters don't fare much better. There's more added to the crew but they're one-dimensional rip-offs of the sidekicks from Pixar's Lightyear. They are nothing more than the fat one, the old one, the geeking out fanboy, and the brainy woman who knows more mechanical knowledge than people today could.\n\nThe villains are horribly misused. There's the bat-woman who is treated like a big deal in the first half only to disappear completely by the second. The movie builds her up as something just to fail on that promise, obviously she was intended to be a bigger deal in an intended second season. The primary villain, Nalo, falls prey to something that has killed a lot of franchises recently: a villain that's all setup and no pay off. Between Marvel, DC, Star Wars, and Sony, fans are tired of seeing potential villains built up only to have to wait for a possible sequel just to pay it off. It's tired and cliched.\n\nThe songs are another disappointment as none are memorable. The first movie had one really good song and some others that grow on you after repeat viewings. Lin-Manuel Miranda's style is overused, but these songs sound like a bad imitation.\n\nThe animation looks good but only because it's the same stuff the first movie used. The only sequence worth remembering visually is the final battle in the storm. Otherwise, everything else is more of the same. Where other studios are emboldened to take animation into new styles, Disney seems content to just play it safe and reuse assets.\n\nThe movie screams that it's just going through the motions. It's enjoyable to sit through, but something that will be completely forgotten by the end of the credits."", ""I'm surprised at the negative reviews here and around the 'net. For context, I rewatched the original a few days ago, in anticipation of seeing the sequel, so both are very fresh in my mind. If you haven't seen the original for a while, I honestly can't see that as anything but a plus.\n\nThis movie builds on the mythology and world of the first. Moana, now a celebrated wayfinder, is tasked with finding a specific island for the sake of her people. She recruits some new (very fun) characters, but some old friends return too. (And yes, I am the sort of simple person who laughs every time Heihei does something)\n\nI particularly liked how the characters have aged since the first movie (Moana's parents have grey hairs and crow's feet). And while there are numerous callbacks to jokes from the original, it doesn't feel like too much.\n\nOn to the important part: the songs! I personally judge musicals by the amount of songs I want to rewatch/rehear as soon as the credits roll. In this film I counted three original songs (not to mention the gorgeous incidental music and callbacks) that I could play on repeat. Which is pretty good for a new Disney movie, in my case.\n\nTL;DR: It's a sequel that doesn't feel unnatural or unwarranted. Some great songs, some new characters to love. Give it a try."", ""Movie was good, don't get me wrong. But there are two new characters that get almost zero screen time who would have made the movie a lot more exciting. Mantagi and Nalo. Mantagi sings a good song with Moana and that's all you really see of her, and the villain Nalo is not even seen until after the credits, I would have liked to see more of these two. Mauis song is great, beyond is cute too, just felt more like a long prequel to Moana 3 which will be great but I also don't want to wait forever for like we did with this one....curious if this is how everyone is feeling or just me. Still enjoyed tho!"", ""If this sequel was released 20-30 years ago it would be just another straight to DVD/VHS sequel from disney that no one really cares about and gets forgotten but in today's day and age it gets a whole theatrical release! Seriously...there's just nothing about this that's worth your time. One of the most vapid, soulless and painfully obvious cash grabs I have ever seen, as a huge fan of the first one I am incredibly disappointed that a sequel even needed to be considered.\n\nMoana's character arc in this makes absolutely no sense and the pacing is so jarring that you can tell how lazy Disney was when editing this from the scrapped TV show spin-off that was supposed to happen... If you must watch this, just wait til it streams on Disney Plus at no extra cost..."", ""GenX reporting in. My 12 year old really wanted to see this one. I liked it more than he did. I was not expecting this level of creative 3D animation! The water comes up in the beach and it looks real. The expresions on the characters faces are off the charts well done. Easy to watch action that was clear. The creature designs were highly creative and super funny. What else do you want in a cartoon? The style and perspectives were very well done. There was only a few songs so that was good for me. This film does get a bit dark towards the end, but doesn't every Disney film get dark at some point? I may go see it again before the end of it's run. 8/10."", ""I saw Moana 2 on November 28, 2024 at LexLive in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nFor being a sequel to a classic movie, Moana 2 is pretty good. The voice acting is great, the story is entertaining, and sometimes it's fairly funny. But it definitely fell short of the expectations I had for it. The first film, Moana (2016), was clever and funny and had an emotional and interesting story. Moana 2's story, while entertaining, was paper thin and missing some key elements. Moana 2 tries to be as emotional as the first, but sometimes feels as if it's telling the audience to laugh or cry instead of letting them feel their own emotions.\n\nMoana 2 is not bad. I laughed a couple times and I enjoyed the film. It is aimed at a younger audience than the original film, but that's expected. If you're looking for a fun new movie to go see, and you were a fan of the first one, go and check Moana 2 out.\n\n7/10.\n\n-Steele Wyndham."", ""Nothing exciting here to see. I went with a pack of kids and teens. They all said it was kind of boring and not as good as the first. I had to agree. Floppy plot. A randomly weird new character gives her terrible life advice that steers her to make irrational choices that bring her success. The voices were good but the songs didn't wow. They were definitely not as good as the original soundtrack of Moana; felt more pop in style with less local color. The songs weren't memorable. We all kind of groaned when they sang again.\n\nSome cute and funny moments. The kids laughed a couple times. The other feelings felt manufactured- like they were trying really hard to evoke emotions in the audience rather than just letting people feel in response to the story itself.\n\nMoana is kind of a narcissist's love song and the other characters don't get filled out much. She saves the day all the time and has all the ideas, skills, enthusiasm, gumption, and smartness, whereas everyone else just muddles around not being as brave, smart, capable or bold. She talked about teamwork but it seemed like the other characters (other than Maui) were just foils. Moana was kind of annoying and Maui wasn't as well-developed this time around. The villains don't get much development either. The plot is kind of disjointed and meanders; I can see how this was originally conceived as a Disney+ series. Nice animation though, neat textiles; the animation of the woven sails and her hair were well done. Some fuzzy feeling family hugs; it was nice to see a whole family portrayed positively in a Disney movie. It wasn't awful, it just was a little flat despite the feeling that they were trying very hard. Maybe it felt a bit like a commercial for a new round of toys."", ""We have been waiting for quite some time for this one, and it was... kind of worth the wait ? The plot is good, we get much more Maui, and they do a good job with comedy and call backs to the first film. The music however, without the musical brilliance of Lin Manuel Miranda is severely lacking. It was the first thing my eight year old said to me when we walked out, the music was nowhere near as good. The funny part about the music is, the music that was reprised from the first one managed to succeed in helping upgrade the score. Dwnfirley worth a watch for sure, especially with the kiddos, just don't expect a Frosen 2, or Inside out 2 level of w sequel."", ""Moana (2016) is one of the best Disney Animated movies of the 2010s and that means it gets a sequel even though there's no reason for this to happen, but that isn't going to stop Disney from giving this movie a sequel. Anyways, I just finished watching Moana 2 (2024) and it was decent.\n\nPositives for Moana 2 (2024): The animation looks just as good in this movie as it did in the original. Auli'i Cravalho is still great as Moana and she continues to be the heart and soul of these movies. I enjoyed seeing her teaming p with other people from her tribes on this adventure. The Rock is still just The Rock and he does great in that role. And finally, you get some more great action sequences in this movie.\n\nNegatives or Moana 2 (2024): The musical numbers aren't as good or catchy as they were in the original. The story isn't as interesting as the one from the original. And finally, a lot of the new characters aren't developed enough to get me to care about them.\n\nOverall, Moana 2 (2024) is a decent enough sequel to the original, but it is also a sequel that shouldn't exist."", ""Action!!!! Great songs!!!! Great massage!!!\n\nAmazing graphics!!!!\n\nWe love the wxtra characters and the overall story line.\n\nIt is a sequel but it can stand on his own you do have to see the first one to enjoy this one.\n\nWe were four adults six kids all glued to the screen and with tears at the end.\n\nAnd usually not all of the kids can stay still for a whole movie. This time they didn't want to go even to bathroom.\n\nIt is great for a family day out I think you can enjoy at all ages. Maby kids last then 4 or 5 depends on the child can be a little scared at some scene.\n\nWe were from 5 till 11.\n\nP.s wait till the end of the credit there is a bonous scene."", ""Moana 2 originally started as a series before being turned into a movie, and unfortunately, that stands out. This time, your connection to the story is much thinner, with Moana heading out on an adventure to find other people, but there's very little connection to her tribe or even the villains.\n\nThe biggest issue overall is the music; the new songs just don't gel with the film like the original soundtrack did, feeling like they belong to another Disney film more than Moana 2.\n\nIn the end, Moana 2 does have some fun elements and looks well animated, but it does have that made-for-TV vibe and a soundtrack that will not have the same impact as the original, which is disappointing.\n\nBut, kids love it, which is the most important factor in the end.\n\nBrad: 7 Josh: 7.5 Final: 7."", 'It\'s getting tiresome every marvel or Disney film that gets released or well any franchise from ghostbusters to transformers there\'s this section of people who will spew negativity and hate and have very little justification outside of they don\'t like the company or brand.\n\nLet\'s be real any 1/10 review is instantly ludicrous because on no planet is it an all time bad film, also read the reviews, it says the same senseless rubbish on all of them which makes me think they\'ve not even seen it and just red Reddit or seen YouTube bits. ""Characters make no sense"" what because they\'re new? They\'ve got a master farmer (on an island where they grow food) a ship builder/designer (on an island where they use boats) the muscle and the coconut lol they make complete sense, if she\'d have gone with stereotypical sailors you\'d have 6 identical people indistinguishable from each other. I cannot understand why people create fake reasons to criticise and think it\'s justifiable, it\'s almost slander.\n\nNext was the music wasn\'t as good, it\'s not easy to produce bangers, most musicians struggle with this, however 2/3 are really good, maybe not as catchy but that doesn\'t make them bad, if a song is iconic, being very good isn\'t a negative, just a tough act to follow, again weird criticism. It doesn\'t link to the first... well all the few reviews I saw this in, they link it all the way through the start, from the lad telling the story to the ocean scene with original music to grandma/coconut and tattoos, I don\'t get how it\'s not linked? It needed a new villain and a different story, it had a great one that was different, bit more grown up and engaging.\n\nEven the sister gets criticised, one reviewer kept saying everything was a retcon (word of the day toilet paper) she was a good addition and replaced the grandma as her heart on the island without needing a boy or love interest, she was uber cute and funny.\n\nThe film is great. I\'ve watched it 3 times, the extras are awesome, bacon and eggs especially are iconic and for me Moana is up there with the best IP that Disney have, I enjoyed wish , not as much some of the others, I thought inside out 2 although good was needlessly depressing for kids where as this is bright, vibrant and sends positive messages,\n\nIs 10 too high? I mean personally I enjoyed it 3 times in a week, I can\'t find much outside tiny bits to be remotely critical of.\n\nIf you hate stuff, don\'t go and watch it, if you don\'t watch it then don\'t review, it\'s clear as day when nothing you say has depth or any valid points outside of generic opinions you\'ve borrowed.\n\nEvery good review I do seems to have to address unfair hate, don\'t get me wrong, read some 4/5 out of tens and I\'d not argue with how they felt, they explained and that\'s fine, but flooding 1/10s is just tedious.\n\nThis generation\'s determined to make the world the most boring it\'s ever been.', ""The first Moana is one of my all-time favorite movies. One of the things I loved most about it was the music-it made you want to sing along and listen to it over and over. I was extremely excited for Moana 2 and had high hopes for the sequel, but every single song felt flat and was missing the catchy, sing-along quality that Lin-Manuel Miranda brought to the first film. The songs weren't necessarily bad, they did feel authentic to island culture but ultimately it's a musical. If the songs don't resonate or make you feel something, it's hard to connect. It was disappointing and ultimately made the movie feel really boring and forgettable compared to the original."", 'The 2016 Animated film MOANA was a pleasant surprise, coming in under the radar and scoring a hit with good music by HAMILTON composer Lin-Manuel Miranda and surprisingly fun vocal performances by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and newcomer Auli\'i Cravalho.\n\nSo, it comes as no surprise that Disney decided to create a sequel, but what does come as a surprise is that the powers-that-be at Disney decided to turn what was originally designed as a television series into a theatrical motion picture.\n\nAnd that\'s where this film falls down for Moana 2 is an engaging (enough) piece of entertainment, but it feels like a series of vignettes (Episodes of TV) strung together to make a movie.\n\nThe lead performances of Cravalho as Moana and Johnson as Maui are engaging enough, but...probably because they thought they were making a tv series...writers Jared Bush (back from the original) as well as Dan Ledoux Miller and Bek Smith decided to add a whole bunch of characters to Moana\'s new voyage - and, while they were winning enough characters - they really did nothing to add to the events of the films. The characters were somewhat fun, but they were UNNECESSARY - a cardinal sin.\n\nAs is the music by Mark Mancina. Clearly, Miranda had no interest in returning to this project when it was going to be a TV Series, so veteran TV Composer Mancina was called in. The results were, again, fairly fun (but forgettable) songs throughout the film.\n\nThe same goes for the direction by David G. Derrick Jr., Jason Hand and Dana Ledoux Miller - all of whom were tabbed to Direct a TV Episode and then the film was stitched together - and it shows. The Direction is disjointed and unispiring...but professionally done.\n\nA forgettable, pleasant enough romp - one that will keep the kiddos occupied for an hour and a half - but not strong enough to warrant a 3rd film that will ""complete the trilogy""...a film that was hinted at in the closing credits.\n\nLetter Grade: B\n\n7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)', ""Animation is outstanding. The characters are still fun. Not quite the first one but every element you loved about the first movie will endear this movie to you. So if you are a Moana fan, definitely check it out. The new characters are fun. The universe expansion is smart. I will really enjoy seeing where they go with the franchise. I think it is a rare sequel that can grab you like the first if the first was truly special or unique, so I don't think a viewer should go in with that expectation. But if you want to have some good laughs, feel good about the world, and enjoy the magic of Disney, this doesn't miss."", ""Yes it was fast pased, yes there was not much character development, but my children loved every minute of it. I personally really liked the music. I am still humming some of the songs like Beyond, and my daughter was doing chee hoos in the car ride back home. The singing of Auli i Cravalho was incredible, I did not like the singing of the Rock that much, but that's ok.\n\nIt was a visual and musically great experience. Disney did not dissapoint me or my childeren and that is what it is all about. So dont mind al'l the saurkraut eters that say it is not as good as the first movie, just go and enjoy it for what it is!"", 'Just saw ""Moana 2"", the sequel to the 2016 Disney animated film ""Moana"". Once again featuring the voices of Auli\'i Cravalho and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, it is a subpar follow-up that delivers visually but not narratively.\n\nThree years after the events of the first film, Moana (voiced by Auli\'i Cravalho) happily spends her time visiting neighbouring islands hoping to find others who share her ability to connect to the ocean, but to no avail. One day, Moana receives an unexpected vision from her ancestors where she learns that the reason no one connects to the ocean anymore is due to the storm God Nalo sinking the island Motufetu responsible for linking all of the islands together. In an effort to reconnect the ocean with mortal beings, Moana assembles a crew of her people to assist her on a journey to locate and raise the sunken Motufetu to the surface. Meanwhile, the demigod Maui (voiced by Dwayne Johnson) is on his own separate mission to find Motufetu because of his personal history with Nalo, but soon ends up captured and held prisoner deep inside Nalo\'s underwater lair.\n\nJoining Disney\'s official line of Princesses back in 2016 was the strong-willed Polynesian Moana of Motunui. Brought to life by the refreshing vocals of then-newcomer Auli\'i Cravalho, Moana\'s heroism and relatability has since seen her worthily earn a coveted place among the iconic canon of Disney Princesses. However, Moana\'s adventure towards greatness could not have been accomplished without the help of Maui, the tattooed demigod whose shapeshifting abilities complimented the titular hero\'s journey on both the humorous and informative front. The enjoyable pairing up of these two allowed things to conclude on a satisfying note, but since Disney values dollar signs over leaving well enough alone, a sequel was naturally green-lit to continue the story whether audiences wanted it to or not. Now in ""Moana 2"", we are treated to a nicely animated yet rather uninspired follow-up that does little to stir up the same level of excitement as the original.\n\nThe film\'s biggest problem, in my eyes, is that it never fully invests the audience in its surprisingly flat story. As three years have since past, we see that Moana has now embraced her title as chiefess, exploring different islands, albeit, without Maui\'s help. She has grown since her last adventure, but never so much that she forgets how to be compassionate towards all living things. Soon enough, Moana learns that her island home is in danger of becoming fully isolated from all the others unless the missing link island Motufetu is brought back to the surface. For no other reason than to set the plot in motion, Moana goes off on yet another journey to save her people from disappearing forever, at least that\'s what I assume the story was about. Unlike the first film, which was able to captivate the viewer with an intriguing look at Polynesian culture, this one\'s contrived plot device of a sunken island feels more like an afterthought as opposed to a legitimate way to invoke a sense of adventure. Because of this, most of the magic has been lost in the creative process.\n\nAdditionally, with the introduction of a new batch of characters, the film doesn\'t properly develop them beyond either convenient helpers or a cheap punchline. For instance, one of Moana\'s crew members Moni (voiced by Hualalai Chung) is shown to be a devoted fan of Maui, constantly gushing over how amazing and powerful he is. Most of the time, Moni\'s sole purpose is simply to remark how much he wishes Maui was part of the crew, usually resulting in repetitive visual gags that only hamper the flow of the story. Similarly, another crew member Keke (voiced by David Fane) is a grumpy farmer who frequently bickers and complains about everything that happens on their trip. What could have been someone amusing that reluctant older audiences can relate to is instead a bland, one-joke character who failed to raise even the slightest smile out of me. As much as I tried, I just could not find any interesting supporting characters that are able stand out significantly alongside Moana herself, leaving her as the only person in the entire movie with anything worth watching.\n\nWorse still, the dynamic between the title character and the loveable demigod Maui is decidedly lacking. This can be chalked up to the fact that the two hardly interact with each other until about halfway through the movie. One of my favourite things about the original film was watching Moana and Maui learn to work together as a team. Their relationship was hostile at first, but over the course of the story it blossomed into a genuine friendship between these two unlikely heroes. For some reason, the writers of this film have decided to split them up since the events of last time, with Maui off doing his own thing completely independent from Moana. Most of the time, Maui is reduced to being an obligatory prisoner character with little else to do but make weak jokes that often miss the mark. When the time comes for him to be rescued by Moana, his shapeshifting powers frequently malfunction, rendering him fairly useless until the climax of the film.\n\nFortunately, not everything in this movie is a complete failure. Like with the original, the visuals and animation are quite impressive at most times. I actually really liked this one shot near the beginning of Moana looking out over the ocean and using her hand to help navigate the position of the stars. This can be interpreted as showing how much Moana has grown in terms of intellect, utilising her attuned nautical knowledge to size up a situation wherever necessary. Also, even though they aren\'t as memorable as before, the musical numbers help move the film along at a reasonable pace to prevent too much drag. It\'s just a shame that there aren\'t any major songs that leave a lasting impression, except for maybe ""Beyond"", which stands out primarily due to Auli\'i Cravalho\'s passionate vocals rather than the content of the lyrics themselves.\n\nIf I had to single out just one consistently great thing in both the original film and this sequel, it would be Auli\'i Cravalho\'s voice performance in the lead role. Though not much has changed from last time, there\'s just something instantly watchable about the way Cravalho brings to life Disney\'s first Polynesian princess, embodying all of her courageousness and humility to a tee. It\'s actually refreshing to see a female lead in a Disney film who isn\'t afraid to work in harmony with others as opposed to wanting to do everything all by herself to prove that she doesn\'t need any outside help. Even during the film\'s weakest moments, it\'s near impossible not to care about what will happen to Moana due to the sheer amount of personality Cravalho is able to draw out from the character, something highly important when portraying a member of Disney royalty.\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said for Dwayne Johnson as Maui, who isn\'t used as well in this outing as he was previously. While Johnson does his best to contribute some comic relief, it just feels like the writers didn\'t know what to do with his character this time around to make him seem any different from how he was in the original. The only thing that comes to mind is the reason why he wants to raise the sunken island all by himself without Moana\'s help, and that is because he wants to shield her from danger. Apart from that, if it weren\'t for the fact that he was so prominent in the first film, it\'s quite easy to forget his presence in this follow-up.\n\nThough not without its fleeting moments of fun, ""Moana 2"" ultimately proves to be an unnecessary sequel that adds barely anything notable to the expansive lore laid out in its predecessor. Unless you\'re a hardcore fan of the original film, there isn\'t any real reason to go out and watch it on the big screen, though it may be worth checking out on Disney+ if you are curious enough. Up next for the series is a live-action remake of the first film, and judging by the quality of Disney\'s recent efforts, it\'s probably nothing to get excited about. With that in mind, it\'s not like Disney has many new things to offer us anyway, so you can either take these films for what they are or leave them. Personally, I think we should leave them.\n\nI rate it 6/10.', ""The film works for children, just like its predecessor, but it leaves little to be remembered, unlike the first one.\n\nThe original Moana was a visual result that oscillated between the beautiful and the sublime.\n\nFrom the beauty of the crystal clear ocean to the green colors of the island, the beauty of the universe was seen in a duel with the equally beautiful and captivating protagonist and due to the feeling of weight we feel on screen, the entire world-building of the film perfected the journey and gave it a proven strong iconography, with memorable music and perhaps the best performance of The Rock's career.\n\nThe original Moana captured a cultural element that for a long time was seen as taboo, such as tattoos, and made it central to its story with beautiful arguments and gave its film a purpose and respect for the minds of children, teenagers and adults, with other viable messages for everyone.\n\nThis movie doesn't have that. At least not to the same extent.\n\nMoana 2 is similar to a walk in the park to distract the little ones while the parents have some peace.\n\nThis walk certainly shouldn't be a waste of time for them and probably not for the parents either, since there is enough movement, color, humor and music to disguise the lack of ideas.\n\nThe film is concerned with following the model of contemporary animations in the speed and volume of jokes, action scenes and use of music inserted into the story in exchange for capturing your attention, instead of winning it over with a good narrative.\n\nThe absence of Clements and Musker is palpable. It's ok, but not memorable."", 'When i heard of a second Moana i was excited, the first one imo is one of the best disney films of all time.\n\nBut lets talk about this, as a standalone film without the first its a 6 at best, the music isnt as good, the story doesnt seem as long, it seems as if they are trying to pack too much in to a short time, dont get me wrong, i still enjoyed every second of it. But i just left wanting more.\n\nLets talk positives, the music is still amazing, not as catchy but i love the bass in the songs, and the fact its proper disney music.\n\nThe addition of a little sister for Moana is amazing, it added alot to the film, with it bringing more of a cost for her going away on adventure.\n\nFinally its clear that there is more to come, with the scene after the credits setting up perfectly for the next one, im excited to see what the producers can come up with.', ""Moana 2 is a perfectly decent Disney film and a fair follow up to Moana, but it doesn't really do anything particularly exciting or inventive compared to that first film.\n\nThe story is fun and zips along at a decent pace so there isn't too much to grumble about there. It has a good adventure element to it and throws a few extra characters into the mix which does liven things up. However the story beats and the way it flows does just feel a bit too similar to the first film. I think there was a chance to do something a bit more creative here.\n\nAnother element that is lacking is the musical side of things. Moana had a couple of really great songs, but unfortunately not a single bar from a Moana 2 song is stuck in my head. I'd have expected there to have been at least one rousing song.\n\nStill, like I say the story is enjoyable enough and the film does look really nice. The animation is really well done and it remains an enjoyable enough film."", 'So... Moana 2 is just the MCU-fication of Disney movies. A sequel that introduces a bunch of new characters, gives a returning character a power upgrade and a slightly new look, but otherwise just replays the same story beats as the previous movie, and drops a major plot thread halfway through, only to pick it back up in the sequel-bait mid-credit scene.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, it does all of that on a high level of craftsmanship, the 3D effects and Dolby Surround bells and whistles are a ton of fun, but nothing this sequel brings to the table is groundbreaking, original or deep. ""Can I get a Chee Hoo"" ia a nice song, but even that doesn\'t even come close to the bangers in the first movie.\n\nAnd my stomach aches at the thought of Disney just openly pumping out franchises now instead of movies.', ""Sequels rarely live up to the originals. This movie was fun, funny and pretty to watch. Once you stop comparing it to the original and just enjoy it as its own thing, you can see that it's actually a pretty good movie. I laughed more than I expected to. No it didn't have nearly the depth of the first one, but again sequels rarely do because all the newness has worn off and you're now in a familiar world, where it's harder to be as enchanted. Originals have the luxury of introducing an audience to something for the first time, which always lends itself to a superior story experience. Come to this just looking to be with a familiar cast and a similar vibe and just enjoy it."", 'It doesn\'t match the original story wise, but the animation is superb and there are definitely a few great emotional moments that make it at least worth a watch.

So many questions.\n\nSynopsis: Walt Disney Animation Studios\' epic animated musical ""Moana 2"" takes audiences on an expansive new voyage with Moana, Maui and a brand-new crew of unlikely seafarers.

The songs are also very well written and I really like them. They almost match up to the original movie's songs. One thing to note for young kids is that number 2 is a bit scarier than number 1, so just make sure that they'll be okay watching this one even if they've already seen #1."", 'It is a good movie. Despite of the first one, there are more characters despite they have a marginal role. Actually the first is better, but it is in any case a good sequel that worth to see.\n\nAnimation is amazing and very good quality of details. Music and songs are nice with similar style like the first and this is for sure a plus.\n\nTrama is interesting despite it is not surprising too much cause the main idea is similar to the first one.\n\nIt is good for children and for adults. It is basically a family movie.\n\nConsidering the end, it seems there will be soon a third part and this is good. Well done.', ""All I can say about this movie is that I am very disappointed. After Moana I had quite a lot of confidence in the sequel, but apart from the visuals it is an empty, boring film. There is no story that makes you think after 1.5 hours what on earth I was watching. This was easy money for Disney and we fell for it. This sequel completely capitalized on the success of Moana but didn't deliver the quality of Moana. This makes both the story and the new characters completely forgettable and empty. That's why I only give this one star because it was so dull and empty that I immediately forgot a lot of the movie and it left no impression and I think that's a shame because Moana was great."", ""An amazing self-help movie for adults! Moana embarks on a new adventure, showing her growth as a leader and navigator. The film is full of humor, heart, and action, with new characters that really add different situations that make you keep staring at the big screen the whole time. I had goosebumps on all songs, they're really well done. Despite a slightly predictable plot, this sequel shines with its gorgeous animation, cultural depth, and uplifting message of community. I wasn't expecting much from a sequel, but this movie full filled my expectations, I loved it! I strongly recommend to all Moana's fans, from all ages!"", 'The story is forced and doesn\'t really line up with the ending of first movie. Then there\'s the horrible music, the songs this time felt as if they where there just to fill time, they weren\'t catchy or really fun.\n\nThe villain, is doing a villain thing for really no explained reason other than somehow what\'s he\'s doing will make him ""more"" powerful.. except he\'s already a ""god"".\n\nAnd the pilot is nothing more than a watered down repeat of the first movie. With more people, that don\'t need to be there as they really don\'t contribute anything. And it\'s never explained where they came from, as in the first movie you saw everyone that was in the island.... So these people came from where ?\n\nOverall it missed the originality, magic, and fun of the original.', ""Watched it with children ( ages 6 and 5) , it kept their attention, they laughed ( a bit less than when they watched the first movie) and both enjoyed it very much. They were not scared of this movie's villain but were of the one from from the first movie.\n\nI think it was not as good as the first but one of the better sequels.\n\nWatched the movie dubbed and in my language, all the actors voices suited their characters so well, the songs were beautiful. The actors voices and the way they adapted the songs to my language was impeccable. The songs are good in English as well but our actor did a better job with the song than Dwayne Johnson ( sorry ).\n\nP.s. Stay a bit after the movie ends, the song is beautiful and there is an extra scene."", 'Moana 2, the sequel to the beloved 2016 Disney movie Moana, is among us. Considering its Production history and how it was reworked from a Disney+ steaming series to a theatrical feature film, I have quite a lot to say about this movie.\n\nVisually, the movie looked absolutely stunning. The vibrant colors, the rich tropical settings, the lightening, and the water effects, it all looks incredibly beautiful especially on the Big Screen. The voice performances are solidly delivered particularly by Auli\'i Cravalho as Moana once again. Dwayne Johnson as Maui is still epic as ever. The banter between our two leads is infectious and the movie is at its best when they are together. Out of the new characters, Moana\'s little sister Simea is the standout. She is incredibly adorable and provides an emotional core of the movie as Moana is not ready to leave her. And that Marvel-esque mid-credits scene was pretty great which has me excited about the future of this franchise.\n\nNow speaking of the story, well it\'s Moana 1 meets Frozen II. This results in the story feeling uninspired and predictable. You can really feel at some points when an episode starts and ends thanks to the choppy editing and clunky pacing. The movie starts off with a rushed first act but then heavily slows down during the second act. That said, the third act was pretty strong and it neatly ties the movie together. Another issue is that the music is nowhere near as memorable as the original. It\'s not bad by any means, there are some songs that are infact pretty good and are quite catchy like ""Beyond"" and ""Get Lost"" but not on the same level as ""How Far I\'ll Go"" or ""You\'re Welcome"". Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear are clearly talented song writers however one cannot help but feel the absence of Lin Manuel Miranda. Moana also has a new crew this time but all the three new characters- Moni, Loto and Kele, feel very much one dimensional and underdeveloped. And the character of Matangi feels like such a wasted potential in terms of being a great villain.\n\nWhile I did enjoy some of the callbacks to the first movie, Moana 2 becomes over reliant on the said callbacks and the repeated gags and humour from the first movie are overused. The humour can be a hit or miss, most of the juvenile jokes fell flat and some of the dialogues, with the use it\'s anachronistic terms like \'buttdial\' and \'fanfic\', feels very much out of place in a movie supposed to be set in Ancient Polynesia.\n\nDespite the many criticisms I\'ve had of this movie, I actually did enjoy myself. The families in my theatre clearly had a good time as most of them clapped at the end and especially the little kids who had a lot of fun with it.\n\nOverall, Moana 2 may lack the narrative and musical brilliance of it\'s predecessor, but still delights as a colorful adventure boasting eye-popping visuals, charming performances and a mid-credits scene that is worth the wait.', ""This movie was super cute just like the first it is interesting has a lot of comical moments and the mythology and story as it correlates to the mariners and their island life and how Moana's character arc grows as well as Maui's is really a great family film that I thoroughly enjoyed watching with my brothers and my son today as a Thanksgiving Memory together. It suits well as a follow-up sequel and the movie is super cute sweet and Adorable. I really liked the fact that they expanded the seafaring adventures for moana to include a full crew as opposed to her venturing out on her own with hey hey and maui as her only companions I found the movie to be thoroughly enjoyable and I think that most audiences and families will as well."", '""Moana 2"" was originally intended as a series, but it ended up being a rather simple and boring film, totally removed from the quality of the first installment. The script fails to tell an interesting story, it becomes slow, boring and cliché, with only the last 15 minutes being interesting. The musical themes are forgettable and lack much quality. The voice work of the cast is appreciable, but unfortunately the character development from the script fails to empathize with the viewer. The only really good thing is the computer-generated animation, which manages to stand out especially for its wonderful colors. ""Moana 2"" is a simple and boring film, a sleeping pill.', ""OK, first of all the people that rated this anything under nine and 10 are completely miserable people. Because this movie was so beautiful and everything about it was still so great for a second movie. It was just amazing. I didn't take my kids and I saw it with my mother and we both cried, I cried about 40 times and I got the chills in the end and I thought it was beautiful. I wish we would've seen more of the bat God But other than that I loved every second of it so don't listen to all these other people who are reading it terribly because it is definitely a beautiful movie. I recommend it!"", ""Disney, creatively still at rock bottom, is struggling to find commercial hits in the interests of its shareholders. This means that overpaid heads, whatever their qualifications, sit down together and, instead of creating something new, consider which former success they could reissue. This time, the choice fell on what is probably the last popular character. Respect!\n\nIs there at least a great story? No. Our heroine embarks on another journey, this time to ensure the continuation of the species according to Mendel's rules. But it doesn't matter, the young target audience should and will enjoy the impressive visuals and the tried and tested characters. Fortunately, there are also some entertaining new ones, even if they are insufficiently illuminated. It is and remains a children's film, there is no room for dramaturgical necessity! Doesn't it? It's been done differently in this genre and children shouldn't be underestimated, let alone taken for fools or even made to feel stupid. The soundtrack is undeniably uninspiring, a barely memorable singsong. Thanks to the power of the media, the film will make considerably more money in the 2020s, even with considerably less quality. That is the commercial definition of art these days, that means success.\n\nAttention, another piece of good news for Muana hardliners who can no longer be deterred. Disney's wealth of ideas has yet another highlight: a live-action film adaptation is coming. Pathetic. And probably Muana 3, with considerably less waiting time, because there are no new concepts."", 'I took my daughter to see this at the cinema. We watched the first Moana movie the night before to refresh or memories. Is not a bad movie, just dull. The story is so basic and predictable, it\'s just very lazily written. It has this ""thing"" they have to overcome, and they overcome it. It feels like they sat down and said ""right, we need to make some money out of this franchise"" and they pushed a button on an AI story generator. It doesn\'t feel like it was created by a writer with a passion for telling a story. It feels like it was created to make some money. And it will do that very well.\n\nThe Rock character is becoming irritating, not as bad as JarJar Bink\'s, but not far off. I think for a kids movie it should be funnier and more engaging. There wasn\'t much laughter in the cinema and a lot of parents seemed to struggle to keep their kids attention on the movie.\n\nA kids movie should really capture their imagination. Usually after a movie my daughter can\'t do talking about it. She gets so caught up in it that her mind is buzzing. However after this movie she hasn\'t said anything about it at all. And I think that sums it up. There\'s nothing to say about it.', ""Moana 2 follows the trend of most Disney sequels these days, trying to recapture the magic of the first film but ultimately falling short.... However, your kids will love it. They missed the mark by introducing too many new characters that didn't connect with the audience and recycling jokes from the first movie, not to mention the lackluster soundtrack - why they didn't bring back Lin Manuel Miranda for this one is a mystery, as his catchy melodies and his vast array of musical influences are what made the first Moana's soundtrack an absolute standout. This one: Not so much. Wait for D+ release."", ""We watched Moana when the children were little and we all loved it. We wasn't expecting much given Disneys run of form but when it was release, it really was a surprise.\n\nSome eight years later Moana 2 comes out. We were all excited to go and see the movie but I'm afraid it didn't live up to expectations. Let's face it, sequels rarely do. I can think of a handful which you can argue the case for, such as Empire Strikes Back, Back to the Future 2 and Aliens. While Moana 2 wasn't a bad movie it just didn't capture the magic of the first one. The story for me felt rushed. It had hints of the first story. The characters (new) lacked development and were generally annoying or didn't add anything. The animation is fantastic, no one can deny but it lacked depth and the music, this was the most disappointing thing. The first one had great songs such as, I am Moana and you're welcome to name a few. I can't actually remember one song from number two.\n\nAs my 11 and 9 year old girls said, it was okay just meh. I think that sums it up.\n\nA lost opportunity but always difficult to follow the first."", ""Yeah sure the 1st Moana was great, the songs were amazing, it's a fantastic original idea.\n\nBUT I don't think it was as magical, as sentimental, or as heartfelt as Moana 2, sure in Moana 1, there's some bits that pulled at your heart strings but it was mostly comedy moments, the 'will he won't he help' conundrum that's been played over & over. The songs in the first are second to none, perhaps that's where Moana 2 may be failing, but sometimes you need to warm up to music.\n\nFor me, Moana 2 was a masterpiece, a true coming together, feel good, make you cry film. It's downfall maybe? Comparison."", ""Moana 2 was originally supposed to be a TV show; the resulting story is so tightly compressed that there is little time or space for drama and character development. What the filmmakers substituted for these crucial elements is a heavy handed slathering of magic that comes across as the movie equivalent of a 100 minute Disney park parade - oppressive in its relentless exuberance. Don't get me wrong- magic is key to Disney storytelling, but those moments have to be earned and they aren't in Moana 2. When the premise is always apocalyptic (as it is with recent Marvel movies), nothing real is at stake and the outcome is never in doubt...and we stop caring about the human consequences. When everything is magic, it ends up that nothing is magical. This is very much the same malady that doomed Encanto, and something Disney will have to reckon with if they want their brand to continue to be viable in the long term."", ""Story flowed through, music was decent, Moana and Maui were extremely great actors! Side characters were lopsided but they were all great characters at the end. I just don't see how it would receive such hate and disappointments, is because Lin-Manuel Miranda didn't write the songs. I don't know, personally I enjoyed the movie despite of its flaws. The animation was beautiful and vibrant. The flow of the ocean was beautifully executed and so bright. The story is a great one, trying to stop a Demi-God from dividing its people. All it takes is Moana and the Polynesian avengers to stop him and bring peace to the islands. Or maybe they are trying to make Moana part of the Marvel universe! Disney and their sequels of money making. Just trying to understand why the hate?!"", ""The plot and art comes through but the soundtrack falls quite short. The introduction of new characters was smooth. The ending gives a lot of potential for the next movies without it feeling like an annoying cliff hanger.\n\nThe new villain doesn't really have a strong presence in this movie but will likely play a bigger role in future films.\n\nI'm not sure why the music didn't come through, nothing is catchy or immersive. It may be the absence of Lin Manuel Miranda in the musical cast.\n\nThe water continues to have beautiful mechanics, same with details like hair, textures, clothes.\n\nAt least doesn't feel repetitive."", 'The quality of the animated works solely produced by Disney in recent years is really worrying. The story patterns are blatantly worn on the outside like coats, and the content inside is rather thin. It seems that as long as they apply the formula when making animations, they can be worry-free. Difficulty + Forging ahead bravely + Withdrawing after setbacks + Spiritual growth + Overcoming difficulties + Grand reunion = ""Moana 2"".\n\nHowever, this film applies the formula in an even sloppier and more hasty manner. The large group of the main characters has a clear division of labor but lacks novelty. The villains are even less intimidating and seem to just make a brief appearance, with pitifully little screen time. The growth that the main character should experience is exactly the same as that in the first film. Last time, Moana helped Maui untie the knot in his heart, and this time, Maui helps Moana achieve sublimation. Both of them have tasted a bit of the ""chicken soup for the soul"", but in the end, it\'s still the same bowl of soup.\n\nOnly the small animal sidekicks are somewhat of a bright spot, which can make people chuckle for a moment. But that\'s just about it. Moreover, this is exactly the style that Disney animations should have. Without it, the watchability would be greatly reduced.', 'After a long Black Friday, I caught this film together with family at our local theater. When I did, there was plenty to say for this sequel to the 2016 hit. To start, this is an entirely new adventure that awaits for the heroine of Motunui. Star Auli\'i Cravalho returns as the titular heroine Moana and reunites with Dwayne Johnson as demigod Maui in what is believed to be the next step in a journey far beyond what they\'ve seen before.\n\nThree years have passed since she restored the heart of Te Fiti and 16-year-old Moana (Cravalho) is now an experienced 19-year-old wayfinder with a 3-year-old little sister named Simea on her home island. However, she foresees through a vision that something her early ancestor discovered beyond their own island must be found with the return of Maui (Johnson) and can unite other fellow islanders believed to have been lost and long forgotten.\n\nSince this movie was originally green lit as a series on Disney+. For it to be converted completely into a full-length sequel, I can tell it feels episodic with a story that\'s simple for people to understand. It just looks like it borrowed a few elements that can be told one episode at a time. As for new songwriters Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear. They were brought onboard to include a new set of songs, but it\'s pretty clear Lin-Manuel Miranda\'s absence is felt. Even with new directors and two new songwriters in charge of this sequel. The latter duo can\'t seem to capture the magic he left behind. But with that said, I didn\'t let it ruin my entire movie experience. To me, the one redeeming quality from them is the song ""Beyond."" I see it as the true stand out song and equivalent to Lin\'s ""How Far I\'ll Go."" I felt chills with an empowerment reverberating from it just as I did with the 2016 song.\n\nI should also note that like Frozen II, Moana 2 seems to be about world building and uses similar elements that look like they borrow off of the series Avatar: The Last Airbender. Moana brings along on her journey new characters aside from comedic chicken Hei Hei. There\'s the grumpy farmer, the eccentric brain, and a Maui super-fan. The latter crew member named Moni is the Sokka of the wayfinding crew.\n\nWhile new characters, new setting, and a new plot are what makes a sequel different from its predecessor. I viewed the film with an open mind and found it to be interesting to explore other vast terrain of Oceania and the new dangers that follow with it. Neither good nor bad, but enough to entertain the little ones.', ""There were so many traditional Pacific Island tales that could have been adapted for a sequel. These could have had soul and feelings to them. Instead we get poorly conceived and terribly written slop that a two-year-old could have put together. The plot follows a boring main character that does not develop or grow in any meaningful way. There is a host of paint-by-numbers support characters, none of which have any meaningful conflict or challenge to overcome.\n\nThe songs are bland and unmemorable. I could not even hum one 30 seconds after hearing it they are that forgettable.\n\nWhat should have been an enjoyable adventure movie based, on a culture that's not my own, with a few catchy songs turned out to be a waste of an evening for the whole family."", '""Moana 2"" tries to build on the massive success of the original, but despite the potential of its premise and the natural expectations that come with a sequel to a contemporary classic, it ends up sailing into lukewarm and predictable waters. Visually stunning, as is standard for Disney animations, the film leans heavily on its impeccable aesthetics but lacks the substance needed to make this journey truly memorable. The story, characters, and even the musical moments fail to recapture the impact that made Moana such a beloved milestone for kids and adults alike.\n\nSet three years after the first movie, ""Moana 2"" follows our heroine on a new mission: breaking Nalo\'s curse, which has isolated several islands and their cultures. At first glance, the idea seems promising, especially with its potential to delve into rich cultural themes and expand on the mythology of the original. However, the plot drags, bogged down by an uneven pace and an overfocus on secondary characters who add little to the story. Kele, Loto, and Moni, introduced as Moana\'s new allies, have shallow arcs that fail to engage or build an emotional connection. Worse, the dynamic between Moana and Maui-such a crucial and heartwarming element in the first film-takes far too long to reemerge, reducing the impact of a relationship that should\'ve been the backbone of the narrative.\n\nThe adventure itself also stumbles, never really taking off. The sense of discovery and triumph that defined the first film is replaced by conflicts that, while visually impressive, lack depth and urgency. The coconut tribe and the giant mollusk are examples of sequences that could have been exciting but end up feeling like episodic detours with little relevance to the overall story. It\'s clear the script opted for a safer route, shying away from the boldness and freshness that made Moana\'s initial journey so unforgettable. This reluctance to take risks leaves the narrative devoid of any genuine sense of danger or personal growth for Moana, which is particularly frustrating in a story meant to reinforce her role as a heroic and inspiring figure.\n\nIf the narrative disappoints, the soundtrack is one of the biggest letdowns. The original film became iconic thanks to songs like ""How Far I\'ll Go"" and ""You\'re Welcome,"" which not only captured the spirit of the story but also became cultural anthems. The new songs in ""Moana 2"" are fine but far from memorable. Maui\'s ""Can I Get a Chee Hoo?"" is fun and will probably charm kids, while ""Beyond,"" the recurring theme, tries to establish an emotional connection. However, none of them come close to the impact of Lin-Manuel Miranda\'s compositions, whose absence is keenly felt. Without a standout soundtrack, the movie loses one of its most powerful tools for touching the audience\'s hearts.\n\nOn the bright side, there\'s no denying the visual appeal of ""Moana 2."" Disney continues to push the boundaries of technical excellence in animation, and this film is no exception. The oceanic landscapes are breathtaking, with water so lifelike you feel like you could dive right in. The character designs, from Maui\'s tattoos to the quirky coconut tribe, are incredibly detailed and creative. Even the dullest parts of the story are visually captivating, which certainly helps keep younger viewers engaged. However, this visual beauty often feels more like a distraction than a narrative extension. Without a story that matches its splendor, the stunning animation feels like a luxurious wrapper with little substance inside.\n\nOverall, ""Moana 2"" is a sequel that plays it far too safe, and in doing so, undermines its ability to captivate and surprise. It checks the boxes with high-quality visual entertainment but lacks soul, emotion, and purpose. For fans of the original, it might serve as a nostalgic reunion with Moana and Maui, but it\'s unlikely to be remembered as anything more than a pale shadow of the first film. By choosing not to take risks, Disney delivers a product that fails to capture the magic, depth, and cultural significance that made the original a true classic. If there\'s one lesson to take away from this, it\'s that no amount of technical brilliance, no matter how spectacular, can replace the need for a well-told and emotionally resonant story.', ""I enjoyed a fair amount I was hoping to like more with the downpour of ticket sales recently but Moana 1 is much better. Nice thing with this was more members along for the adventure and Muahi is a great warrior as always. I love the heroic vibes, the humor was great, and peacefulness is lovely! Downsides I must say not as much music, felt like a prequel a little, and not as good of an ending as first one. I imagine little ones enjoyed more than adults I'm glad I waited till a quiet Monday to see though it's a nice family experience that is fun what it is. I'm nice about things it is pretty good one at least above average - sorry about my review don't get me wrong I would recommend Moana 2 just prefer the other one.""]",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/moana-2/3aa3b120-5c35-48fc-b346-d27fe120bccb.webp

The plot feels like a lazy retread of the first but I didn't care about any of the characters. Paul Mescal was so wooden it sounded like he was reading his lines. If this is how he acts, I really don't see what all the fuss is about with him. Am I missing something.\n\nThe action, while visually impressive, lacked impact. Some studio exec probably thought 'hmm there was only 1 exotic animal in the first film, we can do better! Let's add way more!'"", ""My main issue with this film is the total lack of gravitas from Paul Mescal. Russel Crow commanded respect, on screen his presence was immense and it was easy to believe he was a leader of men. Paul Mescal just doesn't have it. He tried to hard in his talisman speeches, but they had to be carried by the music instead of his command of the screen. Even his physical presence is underwhelming, he looked like a boy pretending to be a man. The emperors also lacked a sense of real danger and tyranny. Every time there was a flash back to the original I was reminded of how poor this film was in comparison. If you were hoping for a performance anywhere close to Russel Crowe or a Mel Gibson in Braveheart you will be sorely disappointed. Without the charisma and emotional gravitas of the leading man everything else fails to deliver. Paul Mascals character was very empty, he seemed like the generic man, nothing at all to distinguish him. This movie is a textbook example of how casting will make or break a movie."", ""I approached this movie truly trying to give it a fair change on its own by not holding and comparing it too much to its original, But this movie just pulls of a force awakens and has 80% just recycled nostalgia bait its impossible to not compare them.\n\nIt recycles quotes,plot, narratives, even very same camera shots.\n\nAnd yeah,alas, the first did absolutely everything, every single aspect better to much better and most definitely story/drama character wise.\n\nEven though tis definitely not the worst movie ever,far from.\n\nBut this movie kind of symbolize the state of current Hollywood and how much it has declined over the last few decades.\n\nThe fact so many people praising it confirms a bitter reality.

If you've seen the first one, you'll quickly realize that you're watching something you've already seen. And once something becomes a repetition of something great, it's almost impossible to recapture that same level of greatness. Mescal, Washington, and the rest of the cast do their best, but this movie relies heavily on nostalgia. For the most part, it repeats the structure of the original story and follows all the clichés typical of sword-and-sandal films: the plot, the betrayal, the arena fights-you name it. The irony is that people who haven't seen the first one will probably enjoy this movie far more than those who remember the original."", 'I was lucky to sit through an early screening here in NYC, so let\'s start with the obvious.\n\nGladiator 2 has superb CGI & practical effects. You will, at times, feel as though you are in Rome. Denzel excels in his role and is a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination, and the blood & gore is highly entertaining. What\'s not to like about a Roman gladiator lopping off a head in THEE Colosseum?\n\nNow, the drawbacks.\n\nPaul Mezcal, a phenomenal actor, fell short of what I wanted from him in the film. Without divulging the plot, he excels in one-on-one scenes and compliments his screen partners well. However, he could have done better in group settings where he was supposed to be the catalyst of the scene. As a ""leader"" throughout the film, inciting the rumblings of a rebellion, uprising, etc., we expect a draw from him. However, at no point was there a desire to follow him. This may be a nitpick but when the one character im supposed to be enraptured with doesn\'t make me want to charge into the fray it falls short of its target.\n\nThe story is better than average but could be better. It complements the bones of the original film and provides some fan service, but it is in no way a standalone marvel compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe music score was solid, but they could have taken some notes from Dune Part 2 on how to give an audience goosebumps during its most pivotal scenes.\n\nAll in all, it\'s a good counterpart to the original Gladiator, one of the better films of 2024, and will receive some Oscar buzz, but it falls short of what it could have been, which is a masterpiece.', 'The film offers a thrilling experience, the narrative and character development could have been more robust. At times, the storyline feels rushed, and some character arcs lack the depth that made the original ""Gladiator"" so compelling. This leads to an overall experience that, in my opinion, does not quite reach the heights of the original.\n\nAdditionally, Denzel Washington\'s portrayal is noteworthy, but his American accent felt somewhat out of place within the context of the film. It occasionally detracted from the immersion, making it harder to connect with his character fully.\n\nTo sum it up, ""Gladiator II"" is an entertaining blockbuster that delivers on visual spectacle and excitement. While it struggles with certain aspects of storytelling and character depth, it still manages to provide an enjoyable cinematic experience for fans of the genre.', ""This film was never going to be a Godfather Part II equivalent, no matter how much us fans of the original Gladiator might have hoped or dreamed that it could be.\n\nThe potential parallels are there, as too, are leanings towards this being a virtual next-gen rehash, so if you go into the movie theater expecting something fresh or new, well then, I regret to say, that you will likely be left wanting. Hoity-toity cinephiles will love to hate it for this reason alone, so if that's what you've paid your admission fee for, you'll get your money's worth.\n\nAlternatively, if you go with just the reasonable expectation of having fun and being entertained by the spectacle of a high production value Hollywood blockbuster, you also should be satisfied, and, just maybe even pleasantly surprised like I was."", ""I just watched the movie in a theater. It is full of entertainment battles ( although a little too much spectacularly blood ), the story line it's in the same path as the first ( you are not amazed cause you practically know what is going to happen ) with some changes here and there.

But what\'s meant to be thrilling too often feels absurd, and those same sharks might be the best place to toss this film and let it sink from memory.\n\nThis sequel goes bigger with its visuals, but in doing so, it loses the grounded intensity that made Gladiator so compelling. Ridley Scott\'s digitally revamped Colosseum, filled with CGI rhinos, apes, and sharks, becomes an overwhelming display of pixels battling each other, while the human stakes that once drew us in are sidelined.

There's very little tension outside of a 4th act twist, with everything before being a reskin of the events of the first film. The echoes aren't subtle either, but the characters quote their predecessors and we have multiple flashbacks. The action, the historical details, and even individual characters key decisions make so little that it often breaks the suspense of disbelief (not least of all that scene of kids playing football). Most critically, the key cast and Paul Mezcal most of all (but with the notable exception of Denzel Washington) simply fail to make their characters believable: that the scripts has them always giving stern speeches rather than simply talking doesn't help.\n\nThere's elements of a good film in there.

The guy playing the lead character, Paul Mescal, has no presence, charisma or gravitas, and comes across as a minor everyman character, wooden & insipid, and just doesn\'t make it work.

HOW is it going to stand next to the masterpiece called The Gladiator? To be brutally honest I had kind of low expectations for the movie. I believed that it would be silly and Paul Mescal as Lucius would be quite underwhelming. The movie exceeded my expectations. It is a film with phenomenal performances mainly from Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal and Denzel Washington, that definitely gets you instantly bonded with the characters (one of the reasons why it is a blessing for this movie to be carrying the name of it's precurssor). However one of the main reasons that make me appreciate the movie more than I would is the fact that it almost brings back elements of the old cinema -when Gladiator released-. When explosions and 2 hours of raw action followed by an uninteresting plot wasn't the case in 70% of the action movies. When lines, details and character-relationship development used to matter waaaay more than they do now. And of course the movie doesn't contain these a lot...The philosophy and fan-base of modern cinema doesn't allow it to be so...However even seeing movies kind of wanting to bring that kind back does good to cinema. Anyways, the movie is not better than the first, they can barely be compared. However you should learn to judge things in life completely independently, only then will you realise their value.

We are really missing great opportunities here for great movies."", ""Ridley Scott's Gladiator 2 arrives as a long-anticipated sequel to the 2000 classic, but unfortunately, it feels more like a shadow of its predecessor than a worthy continuation of the story. Where the original soared with emotional resonance, memorable characters, and a tightly crafted narrative, this follow-up stumbles under the weight of its ambition, delivering an uninspired and overblown spectacle.\n\nThe biggest flaw of *Gladiator 2* is its lack of a compelling narrative. While the original film thrived on Maximus's personal vendetta and moral struggle, the sequel fails to establish similarly strong stakes. The script feels disjointed, cobbled together with clichés and overly convoluted subplots that fail to evoke genuine investment. Rather than expanding the world of ancient Rome with depth and complexity, it falls into a trap of repetition, recycling themes and plot points from the original without adding anything truly new.\n\nThe characters in *Gladiator 2* are flat and underwritten, making it difficult to connect with their struggles. The protagonist lacks the gravitas and emotional depth that Russell Crowe brought to Maximus, and the supporting cast is largely wasted in forgettable roles. Even the villains fail to stand out, offering no memorable menace or intrigue to drive the drama forward.\n\nWhile the original *Gladiator* balanced its epic battle sequences with quiet, introspective moments, *Gladiator 2* leans too heavily on CGI-driven action. The fight scenes are relentless but lack the visceral intensity of the first film, coming across as overproduced and emotionally hollow. The visual effects, though polished, often feel excessive and distract from the narrative, reducing the film to a series of flashy but meaningless set pieces.\n\nA sequel to *Gladiator* should have been an opportunity to explore new perspectives on ancient Rome, delve into untold aspects of its history, or craft a fresh and innovative story. Instead, the film plays it safe, relying on nostalgia and surface-level fan service rather than taking creative risks. This lack of ambition leaves the movie feeling derivative and uninspired.\n\nThe film struggles to maintain a consistent tone, swinging awkwardly between epic drama and unintentional camp. Attempts at poignant moments feel forced and unearned, while moments of levity or humor seem out of place in a film that should be steeped in gravitas.\n\nGladiator 2 had the potential to be a monumental sequel, but it ultimately fails to capture the magic of the original. Its lackluster script, shallow characters, and overindulgence in spectacle result in a film that feels more like a generic historical action movie than a continuation of one of cinema's great epics. Fans of the original may find some moments of nostalgia, but overall, this is a disappointing and unnecessary follow-up that falls far short of its lofty expectations."", ""It's Cecil B. DeMille on steroids. It's huge, it's loud, has a great cast and I certainly felt very much entertained.\n\nWhereas Russel Crowe's Maximus in 'Gladiator' came from greatness, the protagonist here, intensely played by Paul Mescal, becomes greatness as the movies evolves. There are some impressive setpieces sprinkled throughout the runtime, and I got to say that Ridley Scott really redeems himself here, after last years incoherent dud, 'Napoleon'. 'Gladiator II' will most certainly be a contender at the Oscars next year in several categories. Denzel, for example, steals every scene he is in.\n\nThe real sets (built in both Malta and Morocco) looked really, really impressive and give that kind of immersion that CGI can't, although CGI certainly was used in several scenes either to add layers or create ships, monkeys or sharks (!)\n\nExcept the fact that Mescal doesn't carry as much weight and has as much screen presence as Crowe doing Maximus, and that it only had a Hans Zimmer-vibe, musicwise, instead of the real thing (or person), I came away thinking that this was probably the best time I had at a movie theater this year."", ""I watched the premiere in Sydney.

I personally feel that it is not bloody at all. There are many fighting scenes and it is very cool. The ending is very emotional and there are many touching parts.\n\nTo sum up the shortcomings: 1. Some dialogue editing switches too frequently. I personally don't like this editing method. I prefer to use a slightly longer shot to focus on one person (preferably the main character) so that I can capture the slight changes in the person's facial during the dialogue.\n\n2. The sea water in front is a bit too real to makes it look fake. The sea water is too blue and perfect, which often presents the opposite effect.\n\n3.

If we must see a completely different story, then we should list it as an original script. But the second one clearly states that it is an adaptation.

The dialogues, which could have added weight to the narrative, fell flat, lacking the punch needed to engage the audience. On the positive side, the special effects and visuals were undeniably stunning, showcasing impressive technical craftsmanship. However, despite these visual accomplishments, it seems Ridley Scott struggled to find his footing with this film.

Just watch it with low expectations and you will enjoy everything that makes a an action packed historical Roman epic worthwhile.', ""Gladiator II feels like one big cliché, reminiscent of the revival of the Star Wars franchise.\n\nThe story follows an almost identical narrative to Gladiator I but goes completely over the top with CGI effects, featuring water-flooded arenas, battles with armored rhinos, and baboons.\n\nWhile Commodus in the first film was a genuinely terrifying villain, his reincarnations in the sequel-Emperors Caracalla and Geta-come across as clownish. At no point do they feel menacing; instead, they seem to serve more of a comedic purpose.\n\nToward the end of the film, there's an interesting twist, but it comes too late to salvage the story from its formulaic structure.\n\nSolid performances keep the film somewhat afloat, and visually it is stunning. However, whereas Star Wars desperately needed a formulaic reboot after the failures of the prequels, this sequel feels like a missed opportunity. In an era where original stories are becoming increasingly rare, a more innovative narrative would have been much more fitting here. Moreover, it's puzzling why the filmmakers would discard all historical accuracy to invent their own story, especially when the Roman Empire is already brimming with fascinating tales waiting to be told."", 'Directed by Ridley Scott, the movie centers on Lucius (played by Paul Mescal), whose homeland has been conquered by the tyrannical emperors now ruling Rome with an iron fist. Fueled with rage in his heart and the future of the Empire at stake, He must look to his past to find strength and honor to return the glory of Rome to its people.\n\nIt\'s interesting; I just realized that this year, we got a chance to see both sequels from movies that honestly didn\'t need one it\'s Joker: Folie à Deux and Gladiator II. What\'s interesting is that, so far, we know which one gets more praise than the other, I think it shows how to make a worthy sequel if it can\'t quite live up to its predecessor. I honestly didn\'t want Ridley to continue his 2000s Roman epic because while it opened a door for more stories to tell, it was such a perfect end for the characters. It wasn\'t much of a surprise when they announced Gladiator II; I mean, it\'s common news from big studios nowadays.\n\nYou can\'t compare this with the first one, you just can\'t because it\'s much more different than it\'s similar. Sure, it has the same main trope, but Gladiator II has a more layered story than before, with more characters involved in the story. That being said, I feel that is the weakest point about it, probably because one of the characters that they keep showing in the promos feels somewhat wasted. I\'m trying to keep this spoiler-free, but these days, it seems like killing off characters is a common way to dispose of them. I\'ve heard people complaining about the fight between animals and humans; I actually like the idea because, 20 years later, with these technological advancements, Ridley and his team are just going crazy with the action sequences. Big Rhino, Baboons? Why the heck not? Also, brace yourself before witnessing the opening scene; Ridley immediately lets you know that ain\'t playing around.\n\nLucius is not Maximus and Paul Mescal is no Russell Crowe. But I would be lying if he didn\'t give an impressive performance. I\'ll just say this, though, throughout the movie, he tries to channel his inner ""Maximus,"" and in the final moments, he finally does it without losing himself. Maximus would be proud of him. Denzel Washington is Denzel Washington. What more needs to be said? His character is one of the best, fun parts (whatever it is) of the movie.\n\nGladiator II is probably my number 1 movie of the year in terms of pure entertainment. Sure, there\'s Dune: Part Two, which was released earlier this year, and then Furiosa just to name a few. But none of them come close to this, I\'m very entertained. I hadn\'t been born yet when the original was released in theaters, but when I heard the iconic score ""Now We Are Free"" playing at the end, along with the memorable opening shot from the first movie, it gave me goosebumps and made me feel nostalgic. ""Speak to me, Father"", that line almost made me weep.', ""Ridley Scott actually tries his best with this movie. The movie is a non stop action sequence, with action sequences that defy anything the original did, thanks to the use of CGI that didn't exist back in the day (actually used well in this film, as I usually think that CGI looks terrible).\n\nThe problem is that the original was carried by stellar actors (Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, etc) and a plot which was entertaining despite being historical nonsense.\n\nYou have none of that in this film. The characters are uninteresting, the main character (Maximus' son) is not compelling or charismatic like Russell Crowe was, and the main villain (Denzel Washington) is nowhere near as interesting as Commodus was, and could almost be a minor villain (he also dies like one).\n\nThe plot, when you remove the action sequences, is also nonexistent. But this is a trend in recent films by Ridley Scott like Napoléon. There are lots of very impressive epic sequences, but when you look at the writing and plot (the actual meat and quality of a film) there is nothing.\n\nI think that Ridley Scott tries too much to emulate the first film here. The way the plot happens is quite similar (MC finds himself in the arena) but the villains and writing is sub par and forgettable.\n\nI feel that the problem is lack of originality. The actors have the talent, but the writing isn't there. Ridley Scott should have made a sequel that wasn't necessarily about Gladiators maybe, but something set in Roman times but elsewhere (for example in Judea or Germania/Britannia).\n\nDon't get me wrong, my dopamine addled brain, which enjoys a burger and a coca cola, somewhat enjoyed this film. But it's nothing more than that. Some critics call it a Marvel type film and I agree.\n\nGone are the monologues by tragic and mad characters (Joaquin Phoenix) with an amazing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. The original was not a masterpiece of writing but it had flair and charisma. This film has none of that. Unfortunately I think it's a trend where Ridley Scott simply lost his touch (Alien Covenant, Napoléon, and now this). His only recent good film was the Last Duel, precisely because he explored an entirely new setting and story (medieval France)."", ""As a rule, I steer clear of sequels that exist solely to capitalize on the success of their predecessors-a trap Hollywood has leaned into heavily over the past two decades. Unfortunately, I let my guard down this time, and I regret it.\n\nThe screenplay was uninspired, riddled with shallow relationships and characters so poorly written they felt like placeholders rather than people. There was no meaningful character development, and the lack of backstories left motivations feeling hollow and contrived.\n\nThe acting, at best, was mediocre. I couldn't bring myself to care about the protagonist or anyone else in the story. Even the so-called emotional moments and pep talks came off as forced and juvenile, as if they were generated by an AI regurgitating clichés from the original Gladiator.\n\nThis film is yet another example of Hollywood's growing fear of taking risks and investing in fresh, creative ideas. It's disheartening to see studios prioritizing safe, formulaic sequels over originality. And we-the audience-need to take a stand and stop supporting these hollow cash grabs before they completely erode the art of filmmaking."", ""Ridley Scotts accomplishments are exceptional, but he seems to be losing his sense of telling the story.\n\nAs to the acting, there is absolutely positively no academy awards in this film. Perhaps something on the technicals, but Pedro, Denzel and everyone else gave perfunctory performances. This is neither Pedro in Game of Thrones nor Denzel in Glory. Mescal did fine for his role as Gladiator, but nothing great. Pascal's performance was sullen, and Denzel was flat. This acting direction is Ridley's fault, because he had the talent.\n\nProduction was fine and all the technicals were fine, but that's not his problem of late. It's the story and acting. The Last Duel could have been great and was forgettable. Napoleon was really a complete (insulting) disaster. Gladiator II is forgettable.\n\nI really hope that Ridley is teaching the technical direction craft to young directors, because his skill in that regard is excellent. The problem is that he's doing scripts that are so average (understanding that Napoleon was a disaster). Here, there's no investment in the characters, the storyline was mediocre, and the ending is predicable. In one scene, a person waking in the sea from a war knock-out wakes to find a personal friend just by an accident that would never occur in real life.\n\nThere's a lot of production in the sets (maybe like Duel) but it's just not a great story. Even the grandiose battle scenes were just okay as battles. I think Ridley might be getting too old to tell a compelling story, even though his direction craft is excellent. Then, he tends to blame the audience. He needs to yield and take the correction to tell a better story, or maybe it's better to say the telling is fine, the story, not so much.

I really felt they could of done a mutch better job and hopefully in the next one they can deliver somewhat a more impressive storyline and better movie. Overall it was okay, some good fighting scenes, although too some of the music included wasn't right, made thibgs look really silly at times, would be better w none. I'm hoping for an improvement in the next one and hopefully for them to included russle crow somewhere."", ""Since Gladiator is my favorite movie of all time, I believe that it's almost unfair to try to hold it sequel to the same immaculate standard that Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe set for us 20 years ago. The biggest issue with Gladiator 2 is falling in love with the characters (or lack thereof) like we do easily did with its predecessor. The movie moved into the Coliseum quite fast, and characters glinted in and out without a major connection to the audience. However, Scott paid homage to the past and provided some awesome plot twists along the way which locked me back in. Denzel helps carry the film, but Pascal could have if given more of an opportunity. Still a great flick to have on the arsenal!"", ""Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000) was an epic masterpiece, a film that combined thrilling action sequences with a powerful story of revenge and redemption. The film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe, and it has since become a classic.\n\nSo, when it was announced that Scott was returning to the world of gladiatorial combat with a sequel, expectations were high. Unfortunately, Gladiator II fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. The film is a pale imitation of the original, lacking the heart, soul, and epic scope that made Gladiator so memorable.\n\nA Shallow Spectacle\n\nOne of the biggest problems with Gladiator II is that it lacks a compelling protagonist. Paul Mescal, who plays Lucius, the nephew of Commodus, is a bland and uncharismatic lead. He simply does not have the screen presence or acting chops to carry a film of this magnitude.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally underwhelming. Denzel Washington, who plays a gladiator trainer, is wasted in a role that is beneath his talents. Connie Nielsen, who reprises her role as Lucilla, is given little to do.\n\nThe film's plot is also a major disappointment. The story is predictable and uninspired, and it lacks the emotional depth of the original. The action sequences, while technically well-made, are also less impactful than those in the first film.\n\nMissing the Mark\n\nGladiator II feels like a cynical attempt to cash in on the success of the original. The film lacks the passion and artistry that made Gladiator so special. It is a hollow spectacle that will likely disappoint fans of the original.\n\nHere are some of the specific criticisms of the film:\n\nWeak protagonist: Paul Mescal is miscast as Lucius. He lacks the charisma and screen presence of Russell Crowe.\n\nUninspired plot: The story is predictable and unoriginal.\n\nUnderutilized supporting cast: Denzel Washington and Connie Nielsen are wasted in their roles.\n\nLack of emotional depth: The film fails to connect with the audience on an emotional level.\n\nOverreliance on CGI: The film's action sequences are overly reliant on CGI, which makes them less impactful.\n\nOverall, Gladiator II is a major disappointment. It is a pale imitation of the original that lacks the heart, soul, and epic scope that made Gladiator so memorable."", ""I wanted to see a nod of appreciation for Maximus and his life. I got it. His dream is alive and in all the fights in the arena and off it, the betrayels, the manipulation, the plans and the hope, somehow Maximus son must win.\n\nThe visuals are very good, the music, the acting, the story, for me delivered. It's not a masterpiece, but neither was Gladiator 1.\n\nConnie Nielsen brought the nostagia, Denzel was perfect as always. Pedro did a very good job. He was nuanced and complex. Paul Mescal i think did a good job. I didn't want him to try and be Maximus. We have one. He did a good job.\n\nThis movies knows about the love Gladiato 1 got, and wanted to add to the story, not re-do it.\n\nSo yes. I enjoied the movie. Nice."", 'Like anybody else, i expected a movie worthy as its predecesor. But having seen Ridley late movies, i have doubts in my mind. The movie turned out to be what close to what i expected. When it comes for the battle scene, the action, the visual, they were outstanding, You have to admit Ridley is the master for this.\n\nBut i just feel the dialog, the character development, the drama scenes are too rushed.\n\nJust a bit of dialog scene here, a bit of dialog scene there, and then go to action scene. There were no bridge between them. Those are the things that this movie lacks of compared to the first one.\n\nI think Ridley or the editor just too concern about the action scene.', ""Giving this an 8/10 rating\n\nBeen a long time coming, if ever thought there could or would be a second film, and it's well worth seeing, was way better than I hoped for and was not a single moment was boring, in fact, it went by so quick I could of done with a bit more!\n\nThe film as you expect has plenty of death, and like the last one, political intrigue, which is the main force of the story and revenge, plenty of that to go around. Paul mescal really does prove without a doubt, he is more than a match for anyone one acting. Denzel Washington and Pedro Pascal with Connie Nielsen bring weight and power for their performances and the film, Joseph Quinn along with Fred Hechinger as the mad Emperors, are just a blast. To be really fair, this time every character gets good screen time in this, second team up of director Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa, both worked on 'Napoleon', last year.\n\nA much cleaner look than 'Gladiator' is thanks to digital, and time, and probably what was learnt from 'Napoleon'. And help with writers Peter Craig and David Franzoni tie it all up nicely. It's pure entertainment at cinema and good strong story telling. Needs a second watch."", ""After months of anticipation and the hype surrounding its massive budget, Gladiator 2 turned out to be one of the biggest letdowns I have ever experienced. First and foremost, the casting was a complete disaster. Whoever was responsible for selecting the lead role should seriously reconsider their career choices. The casting decisions were so poor that any payment they received for their efforts feels entirely unjustified.\n\nDenzel Washington, as always, delivered a stellar performance and single-handedly carried the film from start to finish. His exceptional acting was the only saving grace, and without him, this movie would have been completely unwatchable. Unfortunately, his brilliance only highlighted how weak the lead character was. The protagonist lacked depth, likability, and any sense of relatability, leaving me feeling indifferent to his journey-even wishing for his demise at times. It is rare for a film to evoke such apathy toward its main character, but this one managed to do just that.\n\nOverall, this film ranks among the most disappointing I have ever seen. I cannot imagine revisiting it, even out of curiosity. Without Denzel's efforts, Gladiator 2 would have been an absolute disaster."", ""Ridley Scott, what a piece of rubbish you threw together. Days of our lives acting, quick cut fight scenes, non-sense action environments and poor character development. From such a masterpiece 24 years ago, why even ruin your name on this historical debacle.\n\nIs this just the world we live in now. How does this make cinema. There must be some system that someone reads the script and watches the filming before release. Is the plan just do throw money at Denzel and Pedro in hope they bring the numbers. The original had a fairly green cast and the movie made them superstars. Superstars don't make great movies all the time."", ""Remember the beginning of the first Gladiator, the battle against the barbarians , the mood the environment, the battle Richard Harris .\n\nThat was an epic .\n\nAfter Alien, Blade Runner, Black Hank Down, Thelma and a Louise Ridley Scott lost his touch.\n\nHe's still on of the best directors of all time , but since American Gangster , his films lost Midas touch.\n\nEverything in this film is tedious, repetitive and boring.\n\nThe same plot same conclusion .\n\nA big desapointment.\n\nEveryone talks about Denzel Washington performance and I don't know why.\n\nAnd the shark tank sequence was so ridiculous.\n\nThis sequel was a mistake .\n\nI will see again the first Gladiator had great."", 'The story has so many things wrong with it.. and denzel really really doesn\'t fit well in the movie specially with the way he talks.. its quite distracting actually, it\'s like watching a modern day setting denzel action movie.. this just tarnishes its predecessors reputation.\n\nI didn\'t believe the rumors before that denzel is a DEI hire, but now i think he actually really is.\n\nThey couldn\'t have made the movie reviewed the scene and actually honestly said ""yep, he\'s a perfect fit"" literally impossible.\n\nI\'m sure they had several better candidates they test scene for that role.

Love the spattering of actors from Gladiator I especially Connie Nielsen. She was great and still so beautiful. Can't wait to go back. Ps. F u to all the haters. You all probably think The View is a good tv show."", ""Gladiator II is not a bad film but to me it was like watching The Force Awakens, I'd seen it all before in a previous film & it felt almost like a remake (of New Hope). If you hadn't seen Gladiator you'd probably think it was a lot better. What can't be forgiven is how abysmal the CGI is in the Coleseum scenes with the baboons & then the ships/sharks. It's CGI you'd expect to have seen 20 years ago & really distracts from the whole spectacle.\n\nAs for the characters none of them are as good as their equivalents in the first film. Not the emperor/s, general, gladiator owner or senators.\n\nIn fact the only thing you'd say was as good as the original are the costumes & visuals (excluding CGI).\n\nRidley is clearly past his best, also shown in the recent Napoleon, & should consider retiring."", ""More than two decades since Gladiator marked a milestone in epic cinema, Gladiator 2 achieves what seemed impossible: respecting the legacy of the original while forging its own identity. Ridley Scott returns to the arena with a film that combines exciting action, a drama charged with emotional intensity and a narrative that honors the spirit of the first installment.\n\nThe plot, although set in a later era, is brilliantly intertwined with the events of the first film, offering clever winks to fans without falling into gratuitous fan service. The main character, played with charisma and strength by Paul Mescal, embodies the same honor and determination that made Máximo an icon, but with his own nuances that distinguish him.\n\nThe action scenes are simply spectacular. The carefully choreographed arena battles convey a visceral feeling reminiscent of the original, but with a renewed focus thanks to modern technologies. At the same time, the film does not neglect its dramatic heart, delving into themes such as the fight for justice, legacy and redemption.\n\nThe music, by Hans Zimmer, is an evolution of the classic theme that captures both the nostalgia and excitement of this new story. Visually, the film is a feast for the eyes, with a recreation of the Roman world that surpasses even the standards of the original.\n\nUltimately, Gladiator 2 not only meets expectations, but exceeds them, delivering a cinematic experience that masterfully balances action and drama. She is a worthy successor who not only honors, but amplifies, Gladiator's legacy."", ""Paul mescal doesn't suit being the lead gladiator\n\nPedro pascal does not suit being a leader of an army. The guy can't even walk the red carpet without getting anxiety. Awful acting with no emotion from anyone really.n\n\nThe script is just incredibly bland and predictable. It's written like it's for 12 year olds so they think the masses can understand it better. I'm not sure what Hollywood thinks of people these days but they seem to think we can't work things out for ourselves without the characters explicitly stating what their plans are.\n\nThe plot is bland and ridiculous at points. Who allows the ridiculous shark scene in the colosseum. Moronic\n\nFreakshow of characters. The 2 emperors just don't give off any kind of cunning or ability to do anything other than act like freaks."", 'As good as 2000\'s original? No, but not many films ever will be. (""Gladiator"" is a classic.)\n\nHistorically accurate? Eh, I\'m leaning towards probably not very, which I guess is a Ridley Scott trait.\n\nFantastic entertainment? Yes. Absolutely! Ridley Scott has put together an undeniably spectacular movie. Plenty of blood and guts and gore. Visually brilliant.\n\nPaul Mescal is no Russell Crowe. But he is fine as the titular gladiator. The supporting cast is good. The double emperors are off their rocker(s) and make good villains. Connie Nielsen returns from the original and Denzel Washington is fantastic with a capital F.\n\nWhat else? A few nice nods to the original, some tense scenes, a great score from Harry Gregson-Williams.\n\nThe 2hr 28min run time seems long but I thought the film was well paced.', ""I start with saying that Gladiator 2 is not a 'bad' movie per say. It has good casting, good scenes, a couple of very good scenes and even strokes of genius here and there, but for all its positives Gladiator suffers from the same issues most 'late blooming' modern sequels suffer from: cliches, the ever abhorable fan-services and needless, scenes.\n\nGladiator had a very tight script, every scene, every dialogue spoken built it upwards until it culminated in the masterpiece it was. Nothing felt needless.\n\nGladiator 2 suffers from lesser quality script, needless and predictable cliche and fan-service scenes (which were absent from the original thankfully), needless call-backs (that only diminish the originals value, instead of raising up the sequel to it) and other such faults.\n\nIt is a bit baffling how such great and such poor scenes and moments are in the same movie.\n\nIts worth a watch, its entertaining, but it does not live up to its predecessor by any means."", ""How is it possible that a director as esteemed as Ridley Scott can, after 24 years, release a sequel which fails so miserably against the shadow of the first? I was blown away by the sheer artificiality and unbelievable elements of the CGI animals which were the rates quality in terms of animation and less so in terms of believability nothing made me cry, get angry, or laugh which means the film was a mediocre attempt and a poor execution of what has been so anticipated for two decades. While everyone is saying Denzel Washington gave a great performance, I don't disagree - but I think it was misplaced to have cast him with his American accent in the midst of British accented actors which seems more fitting given the factorisation of Rome as a imperial power and following the same style and motif as the first. I was really disappointed, and unfortunately unlike the first, this will be a very forgettable movie."", ""Gladiator 2 is an amazing sequel that delivers epic visuals, powerful performances, and a gripping story. While it doesn't fully match the emotional depth of the first film and some moments don't make complete sense, it still pulls you in and keeps you hooked.\n\nThe film follows or borrows elements from the first movie's script in some areas, but this doesn't make it feel repetitive or like a poor imitation. Instead, it honors the original while carving its own path.\n\nWith stunning set pieces and an engaging plot, it's a worthy continuation of the original. Fans of Gladiator should definitely watch it-it's a thrilling and unforgettable experience."", ""Wasn't expecting it to better the first but I was at least expecting it to be well made & written.\n\nPoor acting all round apart from Pedro Pascal, the lead role I didn't buy into at all. Story line especially towards the end felt completely farfetched and even comedic.\n\nGladiator 2 didn't grab your emotions in 99% of the scenes unlike the first.\n\nMany scenes ruined by CGI apart from Rome itself.\n\nIt could have been made well as the initial plot was something to go off but it just spiralled down a complete mess of a storyline combined with bad acting, bad fight scenes and a bad experience in general.\n\nI'm sorry to say Gladiator 2 was lifeless."", ""After 24 years, Ridley Scott decides to continue the story of one of his best films focusing on Maximus' son. It was not an easy thing knowing that Maximus' family had been executed in the previous film, but Ridley took advantage of two elements from the previous film for this new story. The previous film has never told anything about Lucius' father and the kiss between Maximus and Lucilla indicated that at some point they were lovers when Maximus was still under the service of Aurelius. With these ambiguous details it was enough to create this story focused on Lucius to make a direct connection with the previous film without having to create a derivative story. Ridley Scott knew how to create a sequel that remains well linked to the canon of the previous film and it was something that was already planned since the release of the first film. Carrying out this project took too long because DreamWorks had sold the rights to Paramount. Lucius, Lucilla and Graco are the only characters that connect with the previous film. It's clear that a lot has happened because the story is set 16 years after Maximus' triumph. Rome is now under the control of two twin emperors who are clearly inspired by Caligula in their attitude. Like the previous film, there are betrayals and a conspiracy to overthrow the tyrannical government. Basically, it's like the story from the previous film is repeated, but in a different way. What sets this film apart from its predecessor is that there are more action scenes and more blood. Gladiator reflected the brutality and corruption of the Roman Empire. In this film that is doubled by showing a more raw image of the brutality of that time. The film follows much the same path as the Spartacus series. There is more focus on action making the story feel a little shorter, but you can appreciate the fight of the gladiators a lot more. Admittedly, the production quality is better than the previous film, although both are still an excellent representation of Rome in its days as a world power. While Gladiator was somewhat of a worthy revival for epic cinema, Gladiator 2 is a terrific sequel that lives up to its predecessor. The original film may not have needed a sequel at the time, but the fact that a sequel came out over 20 years later has given us a renewed appreciation for the work that Russell Crowe has become so popular for. My final rating for this film is a 10/10."", ""As a passionate fan of the original Gladiator, I eagerly anticipated the sequel, hoping it would deliver the same emotional depth and cinematic brilliance. Unfortunately, Gladiator II fails to capture the essence of what made the first film an enduring classic.\n\nWeak Storytelling The plot, centered on an adult Lucius, lacks focus and coherence. Unlike the original's tight, emotionally driven narrative, this sequel feels bloated with unnecessary subplots that add little value. Moments that should have been impactful instead come across as over-the-top or contrived, undermining the film's authenticity and emotional resonance.\n\nCasting Concerns The performances are a mixed bag. While some actors bring commendable energy to their roles, others feel miscast, detracting from the immersion. Moreover, there's been criticism surrounding the prioritization of casting decisions that appear politically motivated rather than based on merit. These choices raise questions about whether the film's focus was on storytelling or making statements unrelated to the narrative.\n\nOver-Reliance on CGI One of the most glaring issues is the overuse of CGI. The original film stood out for its practical effects and raw battle sequences, but Gladiator II leans heavily on digital effects, which often feel lifeless and fail to evoke the same visceral intensity. This decision robs the action sequences of their potential impact and leaves them feeling hollow.\n\nDirection and Execution Ridley Scott's direction feels rushed and unfocused, as if the film's primary goal was to capitalize on the success of the original rather than build upon its legacy. The pacing is uneven, with moments of genuine tension drowned out by unnecessarily drawn-out scenes or poorly executed action.\n\nConclusion While Gladiator II had the potential to be a worthy sequel, it falls short in nearly every department. Fans of the original will likely find this film disappointing, as it lacks the heart, grit, and brilliance of its predecessor. For those considering watching it, you're better off revisiting the timeless masterpiece that started it all.""]",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/gladiador-ii/a66b2f75-b201-4f0a-9eea-e2aff3709fd1.webp

Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.\n\nNot everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.\n\nFarming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie\'s sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.\n\nThe music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer\'s harmonies captivated watchers\' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.\n\nYes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven\'t encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor\'s performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.\n\nI walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special.

A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema."", 'I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything.\n\nRight off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with \'Interstellar.\' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans\'s score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey\'s acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan\'s characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i\'ve ever seen.\n\nUltimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don\'t think this is Nolan\'s best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan\'s most ambitious and visually-striking work.\n\nBy the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is out of their mind. Kubrick\'s mission was to create art. Nolan in ""Interstellar"" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work.', ""All is amazing. I can't describe anything. It's a film that leads you to think about yourself and your plans in your life. I am a real series/movies' lover and... This was awesome."", ""Interstellar - Review\n\nCertain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.\n\nWhy you might ask?\n\nWell seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.\n\nThe images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes.\n\n..\n\n.\n\nWell apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :)."", ""I hadn't seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR. One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have"", ""There is not even a single day I don't think of this movie, it's scenes , it has a profound impact on me and it shall remain with me forever."", 'I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.\n\nAnd this is IT!\n\nWhen I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I\'m sure it will.\n\nFirst of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.\n\nThe sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are.\n\nThese two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).\n\nThen, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn\'t really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.\n\nAnd finally, the scenario/story. I won\'t spoil anything here; I\'ll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he\'s revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet).\n\nWhy? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can\'t be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.\n\nBecause, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to convince you about that.\n\nMy rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can\'t compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don\'t live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don\'t think so. Only time will answer that.\n\nThis is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.', ""It's difficult to put into words how powerful this film is. In fact, I'd go as far to say as this is so much more than just a film. After watching this, you somehow feel as if you've experienced a whole lifetime in a mere 3 hours. There isn't a single moment that goes unwasted; everything is purposeful.\n\nThis is a sci-fi film in which the 'fi' part enables the film to convery so many powerful messages. It puts just the right amout of focus on science without trying too hard to explain or prove itself. To me, one of the most powerful effects this film has left me with is the concept of impermanence. Our time on this world is finite and we should cherish and embrace it as much as we can. The film also fiddles with the concept of time and uses it as an integral part of the plot. But perhaps the most powerful message of this film is of the human condition. Yes, as humans we have our shortcomings. But we can also show remarkable empathy, dedication and ingenuity.\n\nI would be lying if I said I wasn't highly emotional while watching this film. In fact, I found myself breaking into tears several times throughout the film. I know this review wasn't very analytical - I will say the following though: this film is so immersive and well done that you forget you're watching a film. The acting is simply superb and believable at all times. Reviewing this without talking about the audio and the music would be a great disservice. The film is accompanied by one of the most brilliant soundtracks. From a composition perspective, it might seem that there isn't a lot going on in the music. But the power of the soundtrack is in its simplicity and the emotions it manages to evoke.\n\nI will end this review by saying that I truly think this film has made me a better person in some sense. It reminded me of how powerful humans can be, and how we should use our finite time on this planet to care and be empathic towards each other and our planet."", ""I understand Mr. Nolan purposely made the dialogue in Interstellar indistinct to achieve some artistic goal. Unfortunately, I, being almost completely deaf, could not understand enough dialogue to even guess what was going on. I can usually get by without close captioning, but in this case, it was impossible. If I had known this going in, I would have opted for a theater with close captioning . . . whoops, this wasn't digital. Sarcasm aside, I guess Mr. Nolan did not think about how his decisions impacted the hearing impaired. I did not vote because it would not be fair to judge the book solely by its cover. I need to see the movie again with closed captioning before I can vote. I hope I didn't spoil this for anyone. Mr Nolan sure spoiled it for me."", ""Was this movie terrible? No, but for as much praise as it got, I'm astounded. The plot was ridiculous and unbelievable. That isn't what killed the movie however, it was the acting! Maybe the director wanted the actors to act that way, but every time they did something amazing, they barely acted surprised. It was as if it was all in a days work. This is the sole reason why I can't get myself to re- watch this movie. The visuals were amazing, but I'm more interested in plot lines and character development than pretty effects (call me old school, even though I'm in my 20's). The movie tries to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but falls short. 2 months after watching Interstellar, not much is retained in my memory (I had to re-read the ridiculous plot and re-watch a trailer to bring my memory back). Whereas 2001 I watched 6 or so months ago and remember most of it.\n\nIt may seem like I'm calling this movie terrible, it's not. It's just highly overrated and I need to point out the flaws that keep this from being a masterpiece. Maybe I've seen too many programs about space (Cosmos, The Universe, 2001, etc) that keep this movie from stunning me with the visuals, but if you're a person that has not seen too many space programs, you'd probably like it.\n\nAnd just an FYI, this is coming from a guy that hated Gravity and Inception. If you like those, you may like this movie."", 'THIS IS A MANKIND ACHIEVEMENT.\n\nTHE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE.\n\nIS ANYONE HAS DOUBT?', 'Yesterday I watched the movie ""Interstellar"". A poorly scripted and poorly directed movie with an over-simplified pseudo-science and spoon-fed philosophical implications, basically a typically overrated Hollywood movie which takes no shame in copying from 2001: A Space Odyssey from Kubrick with none of its beauty, simplicity and none of its art. It shows that in 1968 they were able to make a masterpiece and in 2014 they can\'t even copy it decently. The fact that on IMDb it has an higher rating than the Kubrick masterpiece makes me lose all faith in the progress of humanity and in our current generation. I will watch 2001: A space odyssey again to forget about it and restore faith in human kind again.', 'The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn\'t hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan\'s directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer\'s soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.\n\nYou don\'t necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan\'s Interstellar.\n\nInterstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer\'s crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.\n\nI have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It\'s much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan\'s best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I\'m not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan\'s filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.\n\nNow, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn\'t been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I\'m still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! ""\n\n*you\'ll have to see the movie to figure that one out.\n\nFélix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014', 'A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity\'s survival.\n\nGoing into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.\n\nThis was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a ""Hathaway hater"" like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in ""Wild"".\n\nThis may be the greatest ever film about physics.', ""(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)\n\nThere have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.\n\nInterstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.\n\nNow, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.\n\nThis is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."", '\'Interstellar\' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I\'ve seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, \'Interstellar\' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don\'t think it\'s fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan\'s films (\'The Dark Knight\' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer\'s score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, \'Interstellar\' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan\'s most beautiful film to date.', 'This film tells the story of an ex-pilot in a world full of dust storms. He is chosen to travel to the uncharted parts of the space in search for a new habitable planet.\n\n""Interstellar"" is a long film, and the first two hours of it does not seem like a typical Christopher Nolan film. Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees \'ghost\' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity.\n\nAs the film progresses, there is more adventure, both in the form of adrenaline pumping adventure and humanity and integrity testing conditions. Matt Damon\'s character forms a central subplot that makes me reflect on what lengths would people go in order to achieve a certain goal. It reflects on the reality that people are driven by egocentric instincts. It is not a pretty truth, but it tells that human are not idealistic creatures.\n\nThe final half an hour is what a typical Christopher Nolan film is like. It makes me hold my breath because it is so intense, both emotionally and cognitively. The ending gives me inexplicable exhilaration. Things come to a full circle, and it is filled with joy.\n\nIt is not a film for everyone, as the story is long and takes a lot of time to build. Two people walked out of the cinema an hour into the film, and someone sitting behind me remarked after the film ended that he opined it was the most boring Christopher Nolan film ever. For me, I enjoyed ""Interstellar"" thoroughly, because it is emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging.', ""Even though I'm a big fan of Christofer Nolan, I find this movie pretty boring. Respect for tackling such a complex subject and for making generally smart blockbusters. Unfortunately, movie is a big mess.

I'm familiar with Solaris and 2001 Odyssey, but this one just didn't work for me. I gave it 7 after all, since I don't think movie is terrible, I just think it's not great, and people got brainwashed by marketing tools into loving this film and giving it such high grade."", 'I think of movies as an art form that evokes emotions in us, homo sapiens. Interstellar is one of those rare pieces of art that stirs the deepest, unexplainable feelings about what it means to be alive-aware of our temporary existence yet capable of imagining beyond time, into the infinite. Its exploration of love, sacrifice, and the unknown feels profoundly human, connecting us to something greater. The visuals are breathtaking, the score is hauntingly beautiful, and the story resonates on an emotional and philosophical level. This movie made me cry, not just for its sadness, but for its sheer, overwhelming beauty.', 'OK, I\'ll keep this brief, but I\'ll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved ""Interstellar"", but I didn\'t for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making.\n\nI won\'t even bother with dissecting the ""science"" in the film, because that isn\'t really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I\'m not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I\'ll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don\'t a great movie make.\n\nThe issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost.\n\nThe characters are paper-thin, and I didn\'t care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior ""Contact""). The special effects aren\'t special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact.\n\nI won\'t go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to ""A Perfect Storm"" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden.\n\nI\'ve probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn\'t doze off, although I desperately wanted to.\n\nSo in conclusion, ""Contact"" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say.\n\nContact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears.', ""The fate of humanity rests in the hands of a small number of NASA pilots, who travel through a work hole in search of a new home.\n\nI've only watched it for the second time, the first being when it first arrived on the big screen.

His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won\'t forget this trip, this can be assured.\n\nI was madly waiting for Interstellar\'s release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer\'s imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn\'t want to let her dad in the infinity darkness.\n\nStarting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it\'s all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won\'t fly quickly for you. You\'ll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of ""Endurance"" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself.\n\nThe emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey\'s character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy\' and Jessica Chastain\' character. And the acting work of these three artists in ""Interstellar"" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film\'s supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere.\n\nThe script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the ""Space Odyssey"" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It\'s also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan\'s work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar.\n\nHans Zimmer\'s score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: ""Once we become parents, we can\'t help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children"", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself.\n\nVisual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The ""Endurance"" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick\'s ""Odyssey"", and they are pleasing to the eye.\n\nMany thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan\'s life.\n\n""Interstellar"" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan\'s genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again.\n\n""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light.""', 'The earth is plagued with droughts, famines and other apocalyptic disasters. Mankind must find a way to leave planet earth once and for all. An earth-like planet has been discovered in another solar system. A spaceship can travel fast through a wormhole though interstellar space but can Cooper get there and return to earth in time to see his daughter before she grows too old?\n\nThe Aging of Murph vs her father Cooper the answer is relativity playing a factor in aging - how fast time runs depend on the relative position of the observer and the subject.\n\nIncredible movie - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n10/10', ""So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:\n\nTo avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.\n\nInterstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.\n\nFor seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.\n\nSimilarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.\n\nOne thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.\n\nAfter watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.\n\nBecause sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us."", ""I have to begin this review by acknowledging that I saw this movie under less than optimal conditions - on the screen on the back of a Jet Blue seat. Whatever visual magic might have impressed me was grainy and small, and the sound was murky. There's a good chance I would have liked this film better if seen properly.\n\nThat being said, I probably wouldn't have liked it a *lot* better, because the things I didn't like would have been the same.\n\nFirst off, I thought the movie was off to a real slow start. It was basically a dust bowl family saga, and while I'll admit you needed some context for what happens later, it felt like it went on much too long.\n\nThe early space experience also didn't engage me that much. Part of the problem might just be my expectations for a Christopher Nolan movie. I knew almost nothing about this film going in, but I think of Nolan as the director of Inception and Memento, and Interstellar was just so darn straightforward (at least at first).\n\nEventually (the movie is almost three hours, so it really takes its time) the film's more intriguing ideas appear, such as the trickiness of relative time. The movie also becomes more eventful. Yet still there were things I found offputting; the first death in the movie makes no sense; it shouldn't have happened, and realistically wouldn't have. (Later I read a critique that pointed out that the whole scene wouldn't have happened that way unless everyone involved was an idiot.)\n\nThe movie did, become more engrossing as it got more involved, playing with its time concept and tossed in some interesting twists and suspenseful moments.\n\nAlas, whatever gains the movie had made in my heart were squandered in the end. Apparently the movie had a scientist to make sure the science was good, and perhaps it was, yet to me the final part seemed incredibly silly, with way too much leaning on non-science things like intuition. And the last scenes were just .... huh? (Although someone in the IMDb board came up with a very Christopher Nolan interpretation of the end that I found more appealing.)\n\nAs I say, if I'd seen it on the big screen I might have been more forgiving of its flaws, and it's very possible things like the reportedly hardcore seriousness with which it approached getting the look of a black hole just right would have made its length and plot weaknesses more palatable. But even saying that, I cannot see any way this movie would ever impress me as much as it has others."", 'The key of this movie may feel like you\'re watching only a Science-Fiction movie. Most of the times Sci-Fi movies are not great at telling an effective, emotional drama stories. You can\'t find this type of movie easily, unless you are watching a Sci-Fi movie directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Jonathan Nolan.\n\nMixing those two genres is unique and dangerous. All the Nolan\'s projects are a bit dangerous and special.\n\nNot only the storyline is so great but also nearly all other technical details are great!\n\nBrilliant scores that composed by Hans Zimmer.\n\nThe film editing is just beyond perfect. One of the best film editings of all time.\n\nThe Cinematography by Wally Pfister is quite realistic and charming.\n\nThe VFX are just stunning. Even the scientist are amazed by how great it is.\n\nSome of the people thinks this movie is based on wrong theories, so that makes it a bad movie. As you may know, all the movies are based on wrong things. You are watching a Sci-Fi movie. In being realistic, Sci-Fi movies are just one step ahead of Fantasy. Why would you look for reality in this movies? It\'s not a crime movie. If people would demand realistic movies, there would be a bigger Documentary sector.\n\nThe main reason why people think like that is this movie is not only based on wrong theories. It\'s mixed. Some of the theories are proven, some of them has potential to be true, some of them are not likely true.\n\nBut you can\'t make a movie that reflects so effective storyline with only the truth. Even ""Based on A True Story"" movies are so changed to make it more effective. You can\'t name any Sci-Fi movie that based on all true theories. Other Sci-Fi movies are not explaining the questions at all. And somehow when this movie tries to explain, this movie becames faulty. So better not trying to explain what\'s going on? In this movie there is no major flaw that you can\'t ignore. The main story is just so effective and perfect.', 'This is a movie with plenty of things going for it. Great performances, incredible visual effects, an interesting story, and tons of really cool concepts, which make for a few genuinely powerful scenes, However, that doesn\'t make it the flawless masterpiece of cinematic genius everybody is labeling it as. There are tons of people giving this movie 10/10 ratings, leading to a user rating of 8.7, and it is now #29 on the IMDb top 250. WOW! That is a lot of praise! On the top 250, ""Interstellar"" is above ""Casablanca"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Psycho"", ""Apocalypse Now"", and ""CITIZEN KANE""! According to the users on IMDb, this movie\'s better than ""Citizen Kane"", which has been known as possibly the greatest film of all time!\n\nIs is better than ""Citizen Kane""? No, not even close. The film is full of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I\'m sure if Nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would\'ve been better. A film by Nolan that is better than this one is ""The Dark Knight"", which has a somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it\'s runtime, and is extremely entertaining throughout. ""Interstellar"" is so long that it starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out.\n\nThe film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how ""love conquers all"" seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy. The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences.\n\nOverall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!', 'I do not know what kind of PR team the production team has hired to promote this film, but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher score than Inception... Seriously guys??? This film has 5/10 stars at best, and even that for just potential. Rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it.\n\nStupid, illogical and at times really boring and long. Even though I am no scientist, it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that I have no comments to this....\n\nSet your expectations low- no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted here....', ""Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be!

This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy.

Mathew and anne put on the performances of their lives while engaging the audience at every corner in the movie. 3 hours is a long time for a movie to run for yet by the end of the credits your yearning for more and wishing it wasn't ending.

Life is not about being alive, it's about being free .\n\nI haven't seen this movie for years because I want to forget it and give me the same new and great feeling again. But alas, legend never dies. I invite you to watch this movie. The next hours will be the best hours of your life."", ""Science fiction fans don't need everything spelling out for them. That's why the narration was removed from Blade Runner. That's why 2001: A Space Odyssey has no dialogue in its opening and closing twenty minutes. That's why R2D2 doesn't speak English.\n\nThere's a scene in Interstellar in which Matthew McConaughey explains the origin of his daughter's name. To his daughter's face. This blunt method of explaining Murphy's Law to the audience is just one example of the unnecessary exposition which Interstellar's running time is so bloated by. It is also the first of many inferior echoes of Contact. In Contact, James Woods explains Occam's Razor in a similar fashion, however it is justified by the court of law context in which the scene takes place.\n\nMore significantly however is the lifting of a major theme from Contact in which Jodie Foster never fully moves on from the loss of her father. Jessica Chastain's character here does likewise, only without the emotional resonance because she is so bitter that it's hard to sympathise with her. The other female character in 'Interstellar' (yeah there's only two) also spends all her screen time pining after a man. Feminists - stay away!\n\nAnother silly moment is the shot for shot homage to Event Horizon. This is when one scientist explains to another scientist what a wormhole is. Which is like a driving instructor explaining to another driving instructor what biting point is. It wouldn't happen, like, ever. At least when Sam Neil gave the low down on wormholes in Event Horizon he was addressing blue collar workers so it was, once again, justified by context.\n\nPerhaps the goofiest thing in the whole film is TARS, a computer with delusions of being the next HAL 9000, which is actually nothing more than metallic origami. Have I mentioned it knows a joke? Yeah it has been programmed with one joke and it uses this joke many times. The joke is that humour is quantifiable by percentage.\n\nWhy watch this when you can watch Contact, 2001: A Space Odyssey or Silent Running? Why go for Christopher Nolan's take on Dust Bowl migration when you can read John Steinbeck's instead?\n\nOn a positive note there are some cool graphics to look at. You know, like the cool graphics in The Hobbit or Transformers."", ""(((WOW)))...!!!\n\nIt's almost impossible to put in words, but we have to try and give everyone what he truly deserve.\n\nIn my modest opinion, Interstellar is the best Sci-Fi in human history.

He is Christopher Nolan...\n\nReally guys, what's wrong with this guy ?!! what's going on inside his head ?!!\n\nIt's our job to honor the honorable. Please, Just keep the rating UP, why ?

It is slow, dark as a black hole, loud as an old Barton Theater Organ playing Fugue in D Minor interesting as a litter box.\n\nThe story is thin.....I can't blame the actors, the entire plot is pretty simple. Can't inhabit earth, find somewhere else to live. Interstellar is a repeat of time continuum stories you have heard or seen before, I wont spoil it, but it's all been told before.\n\nDialog is dreary, slow, ponderous. The comparison to 2001 is preposterous. The wonder and awe of 2001 and other movies before it was it had never been done it was the first. 2001 was all done without the advanced technology we have in computer imagery we have today. 2001 was a pioneering effort. This is not at all pioneering, inventive or surprising if you read science fiction at all.\n\nThe imagery is not all that unique or impressive. The constant thumping and droning of background music was mind numbing. Most of the show I was trying to nod off, but for the LOUD THEATER ORGAN playing in the background I probably would have.\n\nI have to agree with some of the reviewers who thought the whole show was ridiculous and in some ways they are right. Somehow science has advanced enough to create interstellar space travel but not far enough to build power cells, clean power, they are still burning fossil fuels. The robots are Lego like, silly looking clunks of stainless steel....it is all so ridiculous.\n\nI would not call this HORRIBLE or AWFUL I have seen some real stinkers over the years. Interstellar is not so ridiculous it is a parody of a good movie it is just not a great movie some had hoped it to be."", ""It's difficult to put into words how breathtaking and epic this movie is. It is the greatest film I have ever seen. The blending of a close, intimate father daughter relationship with a larger than life space expedition to save humanity is executed brilliantly by Nolan and crew. The visual effects, story line, writing, acting, and scientific accuracy were all perfect in my eyes, but it's the sheer emotion of the film that gets you. Multiple scenes will have you wiping your eyes as Nolan's manipulation of time in this movie does a brilliant job of evoking never before felt emotions in the viewer. A true masterpiece of cinema."", 'Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it.\n\nJust about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan\'s work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.\n\nWe start in familiar \'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world\'s food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive \'blight\'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind\'s provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth\'s oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn\'t get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.\n\nThe first part of the film is set on and around Cooper\'s farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.\n\nCooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand\'s daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.\n\nTo say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).\n\nIn terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick\'s ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.\n\nEqually stunning is Hans Zimmer\'s score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn\'t ""go quietly into the night""! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss\'s estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I\'ve already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.\n\nAbove all, Nolan\'s direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper\'s farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension.\n\nI\'ve decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character\'s dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).\n\nHowever, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating \'rule\'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE\x85 THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

Time that should have been dedicated to the actual space travel.\n\nA very slow burn, but the acting is great.\n\nA serious lack of explanation for things they want you to swallow for the story to make sense.\n\nI give it a one time watch value of 7; with a rewatch value of 4.\n\nTogether - a 6.\n\nDecent, but the hype around this film makes no sense; almost as much as the 'science' involved."", 'All of the fanboys and girls must have also been in love with ""The Emperor Has No Clothes"" too.\n\nThis story is thin, the characters are under developed, the emotional and logical shortcuts are ridiculous, Matt Damon is horribly cast and has become a caricature of himself, the set pieces are not inspiring, the music cues try to be bombastic enough to create emotion that simply doesn\'t exist and the science is a mess.\n\nWhen a self-important filmmaker reaches a level of success where no one will tell them ""no"" anymore, this is what comes of it. The scientific equation that sums up this film is as follows: Nolan + Interstellar = Lucas/Spielberg + Crystal Skull.\n\nA completely unremarkable and forgettable film. The Emperor truly has no clothes.', 'OK, I\'ve just seen Interstellar and I can tell it\'s one of those movies that you either love or hate.\n\nPersonally I loved it and probably I\'m going to watch it again to process it a little bit more. It\'s not a simple movie, maybe that was already clear, is a Nolan\'s film.\n\nMatthew McConaughey does a great job by portraying Cooper. The most touching scenes are those between his character and Mackenzie Foy, who plays the younger version of Murph, Jessica Chastain character. Either it seems to be an ""Outer Space Film"" is more about human relations and how important is for us to be linked with others.\n\nEven it\'s a long movie, 169 minutes, I didn\'t felt it that long or tedious. The director managed to keep us engaged through the whole film.\n\nThe experience on IMAX in 70mm film. The image quality perceived was superb, now I get why Christopher Nolan and other directors are fighting to keep film alive.\n\nI had the opportunity to watch it at the Chinese theatre and was a great experience, my first time in that theatre. The staff from the theatre even told us that Nolan himself watched several scenes of the movie in that theatre to ""calibrate"" the experience. Which is very cool.\n\nWell, I encourage you to go and watch Interstellar to see of you love or hate it.', ""Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think."", ""I mean, seriously. I am such a movie fan. I watch everything. Nothing comes close to this. This movie changed me. Interstellar is a revelation! Its themes are incredible. How love can be a quantifiable force. Love for one's children. The quest for a better life for them. The strength and courage it takes to step into the unknown. The ties that we share with our people. And if you are just a little bit of a nerd, it leaves a mark forever!...\n\nPerformances are stellar. All actors are giving it their all. I am NOT a fan of Anne Hathaway, and I even loved her!\n\nAlso, Zimmer's score is sheer PERFECTION. It will make you cry and ponder.\n\nBEST MOVIE EVER."", 'I just returned after seeing ""Interstellar"" again (2nd time) and I can say that my second experience was even more powerful than the first. I\'m trying to find the right words to express the thrilling journey that is this film.\n\nFirst I\'d like to advice you to try and pay attention to every single line - nothing is said without purpose and everything is somehow connected. It slowly builds up with the beginning to this phenomenal emotional ride and it will not let go until the very end. It will keep you on the edge of your sit - literally -, it will make you cry, it will make you jump, it will completely absorb you. Throughout the course of it I forgot I was in a cinema. I was living every single moment with the characters, feeling what they\'re feeling. At times, I found myself staring blankly trying to comprehend its complexity - How can this be? Is this really happening? Can it be so epic?\n\nThe second time I saw it I understood the importance of every single scene and line, I saw more connection, more intricacy and (even) more genius in it. The first time it was grand and overwhelming, it just hit me hard and I couldn\'t really pay attention to details.\n\nThe emotional journey part was very important to me; but of course, there are the stunning visuals which contribute immensely and transcend you there, into the action. They were fantastic, superb, simply put, film-making at its finest.\n\nThis is all, of course, from my point of view - a super sci-fi, fantasy, adventure and all associated genres enthusiast. Although I cannot imagine how one, regardless of their movie preferences, can dislike ""Interstellar"" - it\'s that good.\n\nWhat I\'m obviously saying is GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Expect epicness. It will not disappoint.', ""Interstellar is a science fiction film co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Inception, Batman: The Dark Knight etc.) and starring Matthew McConaughey. I found it absolutely amazing, rarely do I use a word like 'spellbinding' to describe a movie but I really do feel like Interstellar is well worthy of it. Matthew McConaughey was excellent as well. He really shows the great emotional range he has as an actor.\n\nThe story is about a group of explorers, led by former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who embark on a journey through a newly discovered wormhole near the planet Saturn. Their main mission is to save humanity from extinction by an environmentally devastated Earth.\n\nThe film was not only beautiful to look at, but it was very well written too. However, like with Inception, you REALLY need to pay attention to pretty much everything that happens to fully understand what is going on. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away important plot points so you'll just have to see for yourself.\n\nI rate it a very high 9.5/10 and I highly recommend it to any fan of Christopher Nolan and anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction. I personally consider it one of the best and most thought provoking science fiction films I've ever seen."", ""What an incredible film, a mesmerizing ride from minute 1 to minute 169. I couldn't believe when it ended that it was already finished; time appeared to go away quickly when watching this in the theater and remember when it ended, I wished there was more of this epic movie.\n\nGreat directing, great performances, the effects/sets could have been better (I like my detail which unfortunately some scenes/effects lacked) and you got to take a big leap of faith to ignore the obvious paradox. If you do the latter, you will enjoy a Nolan's masterpiece.\n\nOne of my top ten movies of all time and most likely the best sci-fi I have ever watched.""]",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/img/cinema/cartaz/4238-cartaz.jpg

There are a LOT of them. The casting? Perfect. The acting? Pretty flawless. All performances drew me in and added greatly to the story. The concept was phenomenal and super interesting. A really great idea for a movie. The cinematography was unique and very good. The score also greatly added to the suspense. The first 2 thirds of the movie executed all of these things to a T\n\nSo why 6 stars? THE ENDING. Took the believable and suspenseful story aspects and threw them out the window in favor of indulging the director's Cronenberg fantasy and desire to max out the special effects budget. It came off as completely disorganized, almost like they had no idea what to do with the ending or any desire to make it interesting. A movie with so much going for it and I left the theater disappointed.\n\nSide notes: enough with the butt shots. We get what you're trying to do, that's enough. Also, if you want to disgust your audience, put in the work in the writers room. Adding over the top squelching sounds to almost every scene is lazy."", ""Every scene of this film wowed me at TIFF. The casting, atmosphere, visual and sound design, music, and, of course, the symbolism of it all.\n\nDemi Moore and Margaret Qualley couldn't have been more perfectly cast as leads. Their devotion to the process and trust in their director was clear to me. Their vulnerability pulls this off and leads to a very compelling fever dream.\n\nEveryone involved should be really proud of this film. To me, it's a future cult classic.\n\nIt is body/psychological horror, so don't expect jump scares. It's deeper than that. I found myself getting lost in reflection during the film (as a 47 year old woman it really spoke to me).\n\nBut it's also extremely fun to watch!\n\nTake it seriously as a true work of art, but don't at the same time, and you'll have a blast."", ""Was an enjoyable watch but the last 20-30 minutes got kinda silly and dumb, it lost its intelligence and subtlety too say the least and went to pure dumb gross out scenery, completely unnecessary especially when the messaging wasn't exactly subtle and was evident throughout the entire movie, from the very premise itself tbh, point is they could a ended on a much stronger note before the final change as it added nothing too what it was trying to say or show, not that it should turn anyone off from watching it, it's a good movie that will keep you interested from start too finish but should've been 20 min shorter."", ""And I've seen thousands. I estimate about 5k movies in my 39 years on this earth. I can't remember one ever hitting me this hard. I was sweating when it finished, even in a cool auditorium. Words to describe how I feel (until now, a full hour after): shocked, floored, stuck, traumatized (in a good way?). This movie affected me. It destroyed me.\n\nAs soon as the credits rolled, everyone in the theater started talking to each other, saying things like wow, omg, wth, BRO, while laughing in shock. These are random people I don't know. We continued to discuss it afterwards. That's never happened to me before.\n\nDon't watch this movie if the following apply to you: You are squeamish, sensitive, or easily triggered. You don't know what body horror is. You're not familiar with dark comedies. You close your eyes at scary parts. You are looking for a date movie.\n\nIf the following apply to you, go see this now, without watching a trailer or reading what it's about: You are fully desensitized. You're annoyed with all the neutered PG-13 movies. You even think modern R-rated movies are too mild and don't go all out. You feel like movies are all the same or fail to stand out.\n\nThe acting is great, with Demi Moore possibly giving her best performance. All technical aspects are pristine, with the sound design/mixing standing out the most. If the director wants you to hear someone chewing obnoxiously, it will sound like the mic is in his mouth. Like the rest of the movie, everything is in your face in an intentionally off-putting way.\n\nAbout halfway through, I was really enjoying it, but I was worried that it would go the way of many style-over-substance movies. They rarely land for me because I need more than metaphors and deeper meanings. The Substance has those things, but still comes through with one of the most satisfying third acts I can think of.\n\nI rarely ever give 10 star ratings (excluding comedies, 13 ever). And rewatchability plays a big factor. I don't care. Even if I only watch this a couple more times, I will NEVER forget this experience, or the images that are seared into my brain forever.\n\n(2 viewings, early access screening 9/18/2024, 10/30/2024)"", ""The movie started off with an intriguing premise. Seeing Demi Moore back on the big screen, portraying a character grappling with age-related insecurities, was both refreshing and powerful. Moore, as one of the most stunning and graceful mature actresses I've seen, brought a rawness to the role that really hit home. Her character's struggles with the pressure of maintaining physical beauty in a society obsessed with youth and appearance were deeply relatable, and it felt like the film was setting up to explore these important themes in a thoughtful and impactful way.\n\nAs the plot unfolded, it continued to develop in a promising direction. It took a darker turn, delving into the complexities of self-perception and the destructive obsession with physical perfection. The themes of fractured identity and a lack of self-love were poignant, and for a while, the film seemed to be handling these modern issues effectively. The storyline, touching on the fragmentation of personalities and the psychological consequences of societal pressures, was gripping. I was fully invested in seeing how the narrative would conclude.\n\nHowever, when it came to the ending, it all fell apart. What could have been a profound and thought-provoking conclusion instead devolved into a senseless and, frankly, off-putting sequence that left a bad taste. It felt like all the promise of the earlier parts of the film was undone by a chaotic, incoherent, and ultimately unsatisfying resolution. The ending not only failed to tie up the themes but also undermined the strength of the narrative. It was a great idea, but the execution at the end dragged the entire movie down, leaving me disappointed and questioning what it had all been for."", 'This is a desperately overrated film. It\'s an interesting watch, for sure, but as a whole it falls flat. While the director utilizes artistry for the story, ultimately the plot holes are undeniable, and worst of all, the ending is just ridiculous to the point where everything good that they were selling for the first hour about it devolves into a mess of a movie.\n\nHave you ever heard of the term \'reaching\'? That is what the people praising this are doing. They are reaching because in the first hour of the film, the movie showed promise, and they are ignoring everything that came after, which is plot holes galore.\n\nAlso, spiritually, it is a negative movie experience. The energy is negative and pointless by the end. There are no moral lessons here of which should have been if they stuck with the depth and substance of the first hour of a woman trying to regain her youth. Instead, it just devolves into a vapid gore fest in the third act that is just meant to stir up publicity and cause shock.\n\nThe first hour was pretty decent, but if this is what passes as a ""good movie"" or a ""classic"" these days as many reviews are trying to push, then we are in trouble. It has those very few elements at times of a masterpiece like many movies that try to push boundaries do, but ultimately it\'s a bad movie that doesn\'t even come close to a Wes Craven Scream film, and those aren\'t even masterpieces.\n\nWe need to cut down the hyperbole these days. Being different is not enough to be a masterpiece, and I feel bad for people who think this is anything great. They must have only seen twenty films in their lifetimes.', 'I was extremely hyped for that movie even though I\'m not a big fan of Fargeat\'s debut film ""Revenge"". I liked her as a director, but not as a screenwriter. While that movie had interesting visual style, the screenplay was bad & stupid and the characters were uninteresting.\n\nHowever she improved a lot from her last movie. ""The Substance"" looks amazing, the shots, the score, the editing, production design and even costumes are well thought out. The screenplay is also great (she actually won an award for Best Screenplay at Cannes for ""The Substance""), the decisions that characters are making are understandable - they are results from characters\' determination to achieve their goals.\n\nI also loved Demi Moore\'s perfomance (it\'s worth mentioning that I wasn\'t considering her good actress at all, but after watching that movie, the first thought that came to my mind was that maybe she isn\'t a bad actress, she was just starring in bad movies), it\'s definitely highlight of her carrer. Margaret Qualley is great as always. Even Dennis Quaid, despite little screen time, gives fun and engaging perfomance.\n\nProbably the most talked about part of that movie is gore and body horror elements. And, yeah, I must admit that this movie is pretty extreme and may be hard to watch for some viewers. Personally during those scenes I wasn\'t feeling disgusted or smth, cause I\'m a big fan of disturbing cinema, so I\'m used to that stuff, but I understand that it may be a hard journey for others. That proves how great make-up artist did their job (i would be happy seeing this movie nominated for an Oscar for ""best make-up and hairstyling) and how sick and twisted Fargeat\'s imagination is.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend this movie. It may not be for everyone, but it\'s worth checking out for yourself and seeing it for yourself, cause even if u don\'t like it, u can\'t deny is isn\'t one of the most insane, extreme and interesting movie of this year (or even a decade).', 'In 2017, Coralie Fargeat\'s directorial debut \'Revenge\' was released. A subversive tale of vengeance, like \'Kill Bill\' mixed with \'Wolf Creek,\' it was greeted with overwhelming praise, going on to make just under a million dollars at the box office. A strikingly shot picture overflowing with thematic weight, it showed Fargeat as a filmmaker unafraid to push boundaries and challenge conventions; a visionary with bold ideas.\n\nA notion compounded by her second feature \'The Substance\'. A satirical body-horror, it centres on Elisabeth Sparkle, a fading Hollywood starlet. After her 50th birthday, she is fired from her job as host of an aerobics show; her producer reasoning she is past her prime. Circumstances introduce Sparkle to a new wonder drug, creating a younger, more beautiful and perfect version of herself- if she follows the instructions, that is.\n\n\'The Substance\' is a wild film, most easily described as being like \'All About Eve,\' or \'Sunset Boulevard,\' if directed by David Cronenberg. It contains much thematic depth, perhaps most obviously about fame, objectification and the ridiculous beauty standards faced by females in Hollywood. Fargeat\'s screenplay delves into the perils of a society obsessed with youth and perfection, showcasing the lengths to which individuals are willing to go to, to maintain their relevance and desirability.\n\nIt is a sad truth that, traditionally, opportunities for actresses dry up after they reach a certain age. Famously, in the early 1960\'s, Bette Davis was having such a hard time finding work that she placed an advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter, offering her services. In it, she stated that she possessed ""thirty years\' experience as an actress in motion pictures"" and was ""mobile still and more affable than rumour would have it."" With her narrative, Fargeat cuttingly satirises the Hollywood machine, as well as the fickleness of fame.\n\nFurthermore, the film explores the duality of identity and the internal conflict between one\'s true self and the facade presented to the world, echoing Oscar Wilde\'s \'The Picture of Dorian Gray\' and Robert Louis Stevenson\'s \'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\'. Moreover, it can also be seen as a metaphor for the internal and external pressures faced by women in the entertainment industry, while other notions, such as addiction, control and obsession, are also examined; interwoven cleverly into the narrative and explored with tongue firmly in cheek.\n\nIt is a visually arresting film, with Fargeat\'s signature style evident in every frame. Alongside director of photography Benjamin Kracun, her use of vibrant, contrasting colours creates a surreal world for Sparkle to navigate; like some kind of 1980\'s hellscape. Furthermore, canny homages to other filmmakers (including Roman Polanski and Stanley Kubrick) serve to heighten the sinister atmosphere of proceedings, which the use of wide-angle lenses and extreme close-ups compounds. Combined with Gladys Garot and Stanislas Reydellet\'s meticulous production design, as well as Emmanuelle Youchnovski\'s costumes, the visuals are unsettlingly artistic and powerful.\n\nThe sound design is similarly effective at generating a sense of macabre disquiet. Much like the lush visuals, sounds are heightened to have the upmost effect. Moreover, Benjamin Stefanski\'s score is eerie and evocative, generating much dread, while songs like Bernard Hermann\'s \'The Nightmare & Dawn\' from \'Vertigo,\' and \'Pump It Up\' by Earl Gregory are used to particularly strong effect. Furthermore, it is a well-edited picture, moving at a fast pace throughout.\n\nIn addition, the special effects and make-up are disgustingly breathtaking. Much like Rob Bottin\'s incredible work for John Carpenter\'s \'The Thing,\' or Chris Walas and Stephan Dupuis\'s similarly brilliant efforts for Cronenberg\'s \'The Fly,\' Pierre-Olivier Persin\'s mostly practical effects are jaw-dropping. In the latter half in particular, they are on full display, and are never anything less than bloody amazing.\n\nDemi Moore stars as Sparkle, and is startlingly intense. She goes all out, holding nothing back- both literally and metaphorically. There are parallels between herself and the character of Sparkle, which serve only to heighten the impact of the narrative and the power of her performance. ""Fearless"" and ""brave"" are words often applied to actors, and are usually inaccurate overstatements- they\'re only acting, after all, not firefighting. However, they are probably the best terms to describe Moore\'s work in the film. It\'s a gutsy performance devoid of vanity, that may be her best so far.\n\nMargaret Qualley does similarly powerful work as Sue, Sparkle\'s alter-ego. Much like Moore, she gives everything to the role, and is equally compelling. She brings a vibrant energy and unsettling allure to proceedings, making her character sinisterly beguiling, and the film all the more gripping for it. In addition, Dennis Quaid- in a role originally meant for the late, great Ray Liotta- is magnificently manic as Sparkle\'s producer; clearly having a ball with the material.\n\nIn conclusion, \'The Substance\' is a thought-provoking and visually arresting film that solidifies Coralie Fargeat\'s reputation as a bold and innovative filmmaker. By blending satirical commentary with visceral horror, Fargeat crafts a narrative that is as entertaining as it is unsettling, making the film a must-watch for fans of body horror and incisive social commentary alike. Boasting strong performances and incredible special effects, it fires on all cylinders and doesn\'t disappoint. So, buy the ticket and take the ride, because \'The Substance\' is a trip worth taking.', ""This is one of those movies that would not do justice seeing at home. You need to be in a packed theater, feel the waves and rushes of energy from the crowd. It's is an experience to say the least. You will laugh, you will look away, your jaw will drop, you will feel uncomfortable. But it's all worth it. It's incredible filmmaking, award winning acting and a smashing soundtrack all in one. Huge applause to Demi for taking on such a vulnerable role covering a subject that is rarely discussed. Looking forward to see what comes of this, hopefully more open conversation within the industry and more doors opened than closed.\n\nJust note, this is NOT a movie you want to get high before seeing."", ""The substance reproduces the things that it wants to criticize.\n\nThe criticism doesn't work because it's contradictory. It wants to criticize the beauty cult but reproduces the fear and disgust of aging. It shows us a tremendously disgusting old female body and places it next to a younger, thinner and wrinkle-free version. With a male gaze all over it.\n\nThe Substance shows us that the worst thing that can happen to a woman is getting old. If she's old, she's worthless, ugly and unloveable. So you have to do anything to stay young, thin and beautiful.\n\nInstead of criticising the system and the society, who are responsable for this beauty cult, the movie emphasizes, how greedy and envious the female protagonist is."", 'Believe the hype - ""The Substance"" is even better than they say. From the opening scene, this film grabs you with its stunning cinematography and powerhouse performances by Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley. The 2.5-hour runtime flies by, leaving you wishing it would never end. This movie is an instant cult classic, blending a fantastic score with razor-sharp social satire that feels both timely and timeless.\n\nWhat really sets ""The Substance"" apart is its homage to Kubrick, infused with a fresh, female-driven perspective that makes every moment feel uniquely powerful. Coralie Fargeat has crafted a horror experience that\'s exactly what Cronenberg should be doing now-clever, grotesque, and endlessly captivating. Loved it, loved it, loved it.', ""We live in an amazing time. After seeing a film with a score of 8, and even with 2 famous actresses, and even with a woman director, whom I had never heard of before, and even in the horror genre, and even in the body horror subgenre.\n\nWow! I told myself and immediately turned on the inflated ratings, waiting, not yet knowing why.\n\nI won't hide it for long. That's exactly what happened.\n\nThe subgenre itself is very niche. Well, judge for yourself: open fractures, blood, intestines. The human body is mutating into something absolutely disgusting. By the way, it is not always only the human body that gets in this format.\n\nAs a subgenre, why not, but it has never been massive, but this film...\n\nThe film's wrapper is very attractive. An incomprehensible description and a bright, beautiful, dynamic trailer. You can understand what is depicted there only after viewing, so if the viewer has not familiarized himself with the genre on the profile resource, he will most likely be unpleasantly surprised.\n\nBut the ratings are high, so the audience was lured by the picture, they slipped an absolute abomination. By the standards of modern sleek mass cinema, that's for sure. And the viewer was satisfied?\n\nI would bet that the viewer was just shocked + the film has a message and some kind of morality, so positive ratings still prevail.\n\nBut I, as a person for whom this genre has existed for 40 years, was satisfied only because of the acting and very cool makeup. They really molded this something at the end out of I don't even want to guess what.\n\nBut if you delve into the plot, the behavior of the characters sometimes, then the picture begins to float.\n\nThe fact that all men are goats, objectification of women is bad and that chasing beauty at the sacrifice of health is bad, I realized in the first 15 minutes. Why do I need 2 more hours?\n\nYes, the camera hitting the interesting places of women is cool done, but I did not come to an adult film.\n\nThe ending is so-so. The scene in the hall is deliberately slipping into trash. You understand that, so it was and it was. It feels like the film deliberately tried to be something sublime and about meaning until the last moment, so as to surprise so much in the end. It surprised me wonderfully.\n\nIt's a shame for the line with the classmate of the main character. It gets its logical conclusion, but in the middle of the film I thought that the authors would go away, but this is already subjective.\n\nObjectively, if you evaluate and compare with others, not even the best representatives of the genre. This movie is just average. But it must be borne in mind that for a film like this, a score of 7 is already a wow success. For understanding, The Thing film has a score of 8.2, and after it there are films of the 30s and only after that the films of Cronenberg begin.\n\nJust so you understand. If the score of a horror story is from 7 points, then this is already a masterpiece, but here ... 8 ... I do not understand. I'm blocking it."", 'The better version of you is you. Not to be someone else nor someone younger or prettier. I like the message that packed in sarcastic way. At the end of the day, you need to choose, your own beauty or beauty with the monster within. Getting older and not pretty anymore is natural. Getting less famous and attractive is the consequences of life. Be grateful of what you have, and being not satisfy with what we have, only will lead us to the disaster. And remember karma does exist. You plant flowers, you will see the beauty. So, it is worth to watch. You will not see scary thing if you understand the message.', ""Demi Moore plays Elisabeth Sparkle, a celebrity who became famous when she was young and beautiful. Now she's older (but in good shape) and we will see what aging does to her career and self-image. With outside help, she creates a younger version of herself called Sue (Margaret Qualley), but she is warned that she has to periodically switch between living as the younger and older version of herself. She must not be late to make the switch!\n\nTo make this film they started off with a big bowl of drama, added a teaspoon of sci-fi, and a pinch of mystery. These elements work well together because everything is connected to the main story. At the end they added a whole bucketload of splatter à la early Peter Jackson (only they had a bigger budget and the effects were of course more modern.) This switch doesn't work so well for me.\n\nI think they got the right actors for the parts. Besides Moore and Qualley I should also mention Dennis Quaid as the dirty, old boss. The cinematography was good. It had some weird close-ups, but those added to the mood of those scenes. The film had some body transformation effects that I liked, because it felt like something physical was on the screen. (The eyes were probably digital, however.)\n\nAlthough I think this is in some ways a well-made film, I don't know who to recommend it to. Some will think the first three quarters of the film are interesting and appreciate that it takes its time to tell the story, but they might be put off by the ending. Others will think that the start and middle of the film are too slow and boring and might complain that we don't get any action until the end. I can appreciate different kinds of films, but it's distracting when you take a too sharp turn from one genre to another late in the film. For others it apparently works better, considering that From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) is a cult-classic, while I've always felt that it's two great films that were combined into one decent film.\n\nIf you're not too squeamish, and like strange films with some surprises this might be for you. Maybe."", ""Possibly the most vile, grotesque, absurd film I've had the misfortune of watching. I'm glad I got to see it for free in my cinema as I'd be very upset if I had to pay for this. This must be the first screening I've been to where people left halfway through. I highly recommend you avoid this if you dislike needles or blood.\n\nWhile the concept was interesting and had potential, the execution was very poor. The film very much lacked substance and felt very hollow. I wouldn't be surprised if this didn't take very much time to produce. It's quite disappointing that this film passed through multiple layers of boards, people, studios, financing and was approved.\n\nThis is a great film for hollow people with very few thoughts or zero internal monologue, it will appear deep, thoughtful and daring to them."", ""The first two thirds of the movie, with its ingenious premise and building up suspense was handled masterfully. The last third, particularly the ridiculous and needlessly gory ending, totally ruined the movie. It's as if the last third was directed by someone else entirely, clearly someone lacking ideas. The great thing about the movie is you have absolutely no idea what direction it will take, and for the most part this was refreshing.\n\nWhen the movie suddenly descended into cheap stupidity, I lost all connection and interest, leaving me very cheated and disappointed.\n\nSome will conclude that I failed to pick up on the subliminal message. BUT, I think that same would have landed more powerfully, and widely, if it was handled with the same degree of effort most of the movie exhibited.\n\nIt's a shame because for a while, it was near all-time classic levels. Sadly, instead of raving about a rare screen gem, i'd be too embarrassed to recommend this to anyone else.\n\nDemi was good and it was nice to see her back on the screen. However, she could have spared showing us her flat and puckered bum!"", 'I have to admit, with my review of her first film (""Revenge""), I did Madame Fargeat an injustice because at the time I perceived it as a pseudo-feminist rape-revenge thriller with significant logic problems. But now it\'s clear to me: the ""message"" is just the starting point - otherwise she mainly wants to have fun and bring her wonderful style to the people, which I really liked it in her first film. This time it was clear from the start: you don\'t even need to think about suspension of disbelief: the no longer very young television celebrity Elizabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), now lead dancer in a fitness program, is rejected by her producer (Dennis Quaid) because of her age. Then she receives the offer to create a younger version of herself (Margaret Qualley) using the substance referenced in the title. But in order to do this, rules have to be followed and this is becoming increasingly difficult, especially for the younger version - with severe consequences. And that\'s where Fargeat comes into its own - even more so than with ""Revenge"". Body horror at its best, which almost makes Cronenberg, Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna look like beginners. Other horror films are also happily quoted (including The Shining, Carrie and Freaks) without seeming contrived or pandering. On the other hand this film is not scary in any way, even if there are effects that get quite under your skin (I\'m just saying ""spinal cord puncture""), instead there\'s a lot to laugh about because of all the over-the-top action. And huge, huge respect for Demi Moore! It takes a lot of courage to expose yourself and let yourself be portrayed like that!', ""'The Substance (2024)' is style. Subtlety isn't in its vocabulary; it beats you round the head with its each and every aspect. Thanks to some really strong, self-assured direction, cinematography and editing, the picture explodes onto the big screen in a big way and forces itself into your eyeballs whether you like it or not. Its general aesthetic is so full-blooded and colourful that it's impossible not to be wholly swept up by it, an infectious energy seeping from each and every increasingly unhinged frame. It strikes just the right balance of campy and creepy, even if its unwieldy tone occasionally feels a little clumsy. It often comes close to making some fairly profound points and conveying the horror of overwhelming, societally reinforced self-consciousness (a simple yet excellent sequence of cruel self-doubt is one of the most effective in the entire film), but it tends to slip away from these more attainable and straightforwardly relatable moments in favour of its own brand of Grand Guignol excess and blunt-force theming.\n\nThe feature doesn't really say all that much; it arguably only really has one idea, and it's a fairly basic idea at that. It's about what societal beauty standards and the male gaze (which itself was the target of the director's previous feature, 'Revenge (2017)') force women to do to themselves in order to remain 'beautiful', about how the pressure put on women to retain a youthful appearance feeds a cycle of insecurity that leads to self-destruction. However, it explores this familiar theme in a relatively fresh way, doing so with the opposite of nuance - perhaps to hammer the point across so brutally that it's finally understood. It does a good job at showcasing the cycle of self-destruction I mentioned a moment ago; in fact, that cycle - or, maybe, the concept of it - is pretty much the entire picture in microcosm. For Elizabeth (Demi Moore), the picture's superstar protagonist, what starts as a means to an end slowly becomes a dependency. Substance use becomes substance addiction, which in turn becomes substance abuse, which in turn becomes substantially worse for our hero than her inner demons and the sexism of her colleagues ever were. Sue (Margaret Qualley), her other self born out of her back and fueled by her spinal fluid, is younger and perkier and more flexible, the ideal woman in the minds of every pig who slobbers over her. Yet, her new skin only seems to increase her bitterness. What begins as appreciation for the body she once had soon turns into misplaced disgust at the body she has now, and the seeds of self-hatred begin to form alongside an increasing sense of worthlessness... not to mention an increasing dissonance between the two versions of herself. In an appropriately overt way, the ensuing internal battle is rendered physical and, therefore, literal. It's a battle we can all relate to on some level.\n\nWhile the picture clearly provokes some thought on its topic, it doesn't exactly make it a priority to convey any specific message - at least not as unsubtly as you'd expect considering its generally unsubtle nature. It doesn't take a nuanced look at its themes and it doesn't delve into the offshoots said theme naturally produces. Like I said, it's only really about one thing. Its characters are designed specifically to feed into that single aspect, and they therefore aren't particularly complex. However, not every movie needs to make some grand statement about a particular concept or feature intricate characters who capture the contradictions of real people. In fact, most of them don't. To judge this for touching on, but not wholly examining or drawing surprising conclusions from, well-worn yet relevant themes would be somewhat disingenuous. After all, art doesn't have to be poignant or profound to be worth experiencing, and something like this simply needs to put its feet on solid ground so that it can mutate into the primal beast it was always destined to become.\n\nLet me be clear, that stuff is almost universally great. While I don't think the affair is quite as gross as everyone makes it out to be (I was half-expecting a physical reaction based on how some people are talking about it), I also don't want to undersell how grotesque it is. While its heightened reality does somewhat weaken the impact of its more gruesome sequences (it all feels a little unreal, so its more personalised moments of pain don't hit that naturalistic nerve the most unbearable body horror scenes do), it also makes almost every single scene feel vibrant and invigorating. There are some really ambitious, gooey special effects and the body horror goes places I'm not sure I've seen it go before. If I have, it hasn't been often. The flick also makes good use of gross-ups, transforming even 'regular' things into something much more revolting. It makes a point of having Dennis Quaid's character be utterly repulsive every time he (dis)graces the screen with his presence. A scene in which he eats shrimp is one of the picture's most unbearable. Although some of them could have been more painful, the movie's more visceral segments are mostly successful and occasionally even somewhat distressing. Because the film is unafraid of absurdity (as all the best horror is), it's also the sort of thing that you might be tempted to chuckle at. It's easier to laugh than it is to allow yourself to feel fear, and - even though I didn't find any of it particularly funny - there were one or two laughs in the screening I attended. If you allow yourself to think about the implications and consequences of its violence and transformations, though, it can be quite disturbing. There are some unsettling ideas and images to be found here.\n\nDirector Coralie Fargeat is similar to Julia Ducournau in that her second film is bigger and more ambitious - at least formally, structurally, and aesthetically - than her debut, but it's arguably less successful - perhaps because it's less focused. When you have this many plates to spin, it's kind of inevitable some will fall. For example, a lot of the picture is shot like a Pepsi/ Coke commercial with a lot of focus on the female form in an overtly sexualised way. It's very, very male gaze-y despite being directed by a woman. Of course, that's the point. Like she did with 'Revenge (2017)', Fargeat is playing with audience expectation and subverting filmmaking tropes to comment on how celluloid treats gender. It's a type of close-to-the-chest satire that never calls itself out as such. However, I don't think the filmmaker ever quite subverts - or, even, comments on - the idea strongly enough to fully justify the constant hyper-sexualisation of Qualley's character. A lot of it is meant to reflect how the lead feels sexy in her new skin and has a renewed sense of self-worth, but the there's so much leering that the work the picture does to offset it just doesn't seem sufficient. There's an argument to be made that the piece isn't as interested in converting those who don't get it as it is in validating those who do; despite its bluntness, it doesn't feel the need to prove itself. While its final third goes some way in making it clear that it isn't interested in pleasing its male audience, it steps into sticky territory in the process. If this movement is specifically designed to be unsexy - repulsive, even - as a way of punishing, or calling into question, the audience's participation in the prior sexualisation, then it falls into the trap of being unempathetic, of putting you in the shoes of its antagonistic forces, of using a woman's body as a punchline to a cruel joke. It doesn't quite go all the way in that direction, and I still think it's a feminist work overall, but it's worth mentioning.\n\nDespite some notable flaws, though, I love that this was made. There's almost nothing I appreciate more than when a film just does whatever it wants to with no concern for expectation or genre. Foreign-language films tend to be a lot more fluid with genre, so when non-American filmmakers make the move to Hollywood (or pseudo Hollywood), they often bring their refreshingly less-than-mainstream ideas with them. Whether they're allowed to keep them in their movie is another matter, but when they are it's often glorious. In this case, the picture eventually goes in a surprising new direction that almost completely upends the established status quo while somehow feeling like a totally natural extension. I knew the final twenty minutes were meant to be wild. However, I expected them to be wild in the usual sense where the tension breaks and some dudes get their heads caved in or whatever. I didn't for a second expect the last act to go as hard and as fast into total freakshow territory as it does. The feature unashamedly transforms itself into an almost entirely different movie, one that's more brazen and bizarre than you can imagine. Perhaps it doesn't one-hundred percent work, but I totally appreciate the effort. I'm really glad it just goes for it.\n\nAlthough it's arguably a tiny bit too long for its own good, isn't as deep as it could have been, is sometimes too on the nose even considering its maximalism and doesn't quite justify its intense level of hyper-sexualisation, the film feels like a breath of fresh air. It's really good, despite its flaws, and I like it more and more with each word I write. It's wonderfully, wonderfully weird. It's entertaining. It's exhilarating. It's arguably essential. It's exactly what it wants to be. It reminds me of some 80s splatter horror at times, which I didn't expect but really enjoyed. The performances are great, even if I don't quite believe Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley are the same person, and they're unafraid to lay everything bare and put it all on the line bring this thing to life. It's stylish beyond belief. It's goopy and gory and going to be talked about for quite a while. We need more movies like 'The Substance (2024)'."", ""I kept seeing ads and promo content for The Substance on TikTok, and one bored day, I decided to give it a shot. From the very first scene, this movie reeled me in. It's an incredible mix of eerie, strange, dirty, funny, and downright captivating moments. The story was well-crafted and full of surprises, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout.\n\nThe acting was top-notch, and the characters felt real in the most unsettling yet entertaining way. Just when I thought I had it figured out, the final act completely blew me away-it was unexpected and so satisfying.\n\nI've been telling everyone about this movie because I simply can't stop thinking about it. It's genuinely one of the best films I've seen in a long time. If you're in the mood for something different, this one's a must-watch!"", ""Implausibly implausible, it took me until the final scenes to realise what genre I was watching. Up to that point I found myself thinking 'as if' or 'get lost' at some of the plot while being satisfactorily entertained by Margaret Qualley's naked body.\n\nTherein lies the problem - as a 'dark comedy' or comedy horror it doesn't quite make it for me and I can't really explain why. It's got an 8/10 rating on IMDb so I'm beginning to think I am the problem, not the film. I'll try: There isn't enough comedy or wit, although more than adequate boobs, butt and blood for the genre. No more than average acting performances although being a slave to my desires I found Margaret Qualley outstanding simply by losing her clothes or dressing like a fantasy hooker. Maybe I approached the film too seriously but hey, somebody has to give it a low score so it might as well be me."", ""Been looking forward to seeing this movie for a while and all I have to say is wow, it sure had me on the edge of my seat. I had my phone next to me and I couldn't pick it up even if I wanted to, it's that type of movie. In all its craziness and body horror, you just can't help but have your eyes glued to the screen. Demi Moore is fantastic in this film, it's definitely one of her best performances. There were parts where I caught myself just watching it with a wowed look on my face and my jaw to the floor, that's what this film will do to you. I would've given this an 8 if it wasn't for the ending that wasn't very good, however, it still deserves a 7 for what it accomplished in the first 2 acts. Personally I think the gore in this film is worse than the Terrifier movies. With those movies I can laugh at it but with this one, it just grossed me out and left me feeling uneasy. So mission accomplished by the Director! I recommend giving this film a watch once, It's a crazy ride that will have you questioning what the heck you just watched. Also, please don't eat anything while you're watching this, haha."", 'So what happens when you take David Cronenberg, Darren Aronofsky, Stanley Kubrick and you put them all in a blender? You get ""The Substance"".\n\nGreat body horror in the style of the 80s. Great performance by Demi Moore (easily her best role ever), Margaret Qualley and Dennis Quaid. Great direction, editing, sound, cinematography, production and makeup. All the elements are there but the ending is pretty dumb and the script seems to lack... Some substance.\n\nOverall, great original and refreshing movie in the style of 80s Cronenberg.\n\nWriter/director Coralie Fargeat definitely made her mark and I\'ll be looking forward to her next movie.\n\nHighly recommended.', ""Fitness Guru Elisabeth Sparkle is devastated when she's booted off her morning show, and deemed too old. She turns to a black market product, known as the substance, in a bitto regain her youth.\n\nI honestly had no idea what to expect, I was hoping to enjoy it, I wasn't expecting to love it. What a fantastic, original and thought provoking film. It's very much in the body horror bracket, although there are a few moments of humour.\n\nIt's definitely graphic in parts, so expect to see some body gore, as well as some level of nudity. Some of the gore will have you squirming in your seat.\n\nYou can't help but be reminded of Death becomes her at times.\n\nThe makeup is absolutely remarkable, and the team deserve massive credit for making Elisabeth up the way they did.\n\nIt's getting harder and harder to tag someone as a film start, but when you watch this film, you're very much aware that Demi Moore is exactly that, a true movie star, here performance throughout this movie is remarkable, she is superb.\n\nCredit to Demi Moore for taking on such a role, it's almost insane to think that she's 62 here, how on Earth can that even be possible. A film I could have pictured Nicole Kidman doing a few years back, she has never been afraid to take on alternative roles, Demi took this to a whole new level.\n\n9/10."", 'The Substance(2024) is experimental, gross, thought-provocative and shockingly-disgusting.\n\nThe Substance achieves what David Cronenberg wishes to achieve - a body horror film with a cohesive theme. Coralie Fargeat\'s film explores Hollywood\'s most uncomfortable truth - ageism (ironically), and also the industry\'s unrealistic beauty standards which prompt artists\' obsession with plastic surgery. The Substance simply turns this phenomenon into a symbolism with the body\'s metamorphism, adding a bit of hyperbole.\n\nWhat I admire about the screenplay is that though it\'s cliché and predictable, in these predictable moments director Fargeat always offers us something unexpected. That\'s the brilliance of the screenplay. Without spoiling too much, we all can predict things can go very wrong for Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), but you will never expect the ending (my cinema literally roared and grossed out). One of the brilliant settings is that Sue (Margaret Qualley) is technically a separate entity from Elisabeth, they don\'t share the same conscience, but their relationship is parasitic (the situation can only get worse for Elisabeth, umm wait til you see). They both chase the same goal of beauty, but they cannot both have it. Sue was born because Elisabeth was obsessed with beauty, but eventually, Sue became Elisabeth\'s ideal version while Elisabeth descended to something more abominable. Elisabeth achieved her goal but she couldn\'t get what she wanted, her jealousy amplified and that\'s when the screenplay questioned the absurdity of the beauty standards.\n\nFargeat\'s Substance is also influenced by lots of classics, notably Cronenberg\'s The Fly or Carpenter\'s The Thing, but the prosthetics here feel so realistic even on the digitally-washed screen. Wochowski\'s The Matrix influenced some of the terms coined here, and Morpheus\'s red-pill-blue-pill scene is also in the interplay. Kubrick\'s filmography also inspired some of the sequences, such as the colour scheme of the studio\'s long hallway (which recurs a lot, perhaps symbolising Elisabeth\'s long and unending journey) resembles the tone in The Shining or Clockwork Orange; the bloodbath from The Shining in Shelley Duvall\'s perception/imagination, and Also Sprach Zarathustra played near the end like how 2001: A Space Odyssey started.\n\nThe performances are applaudable, yet the horrors of this film shadow them. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley played a perfect pair of opposite parts, their powerhouse performance made the horror much more believable. Dennis Quaid makes you uncomfortable, he is selfish and utilitarian, he exploits the artists and ""eats"" them up like any other shareholders. But overall the film feels like a 2.5-hour-long fitness commercial, and it\'s too modern and stylized, unlike the 80s body horror films. The ending is also quite ridiculous but who cares, body horrors aren\'t real, right?', '\'\'THE SUBSTANCE\' a new film by female writer/director Coralie Fargeat, who also edits this film is full of dichotomy. On one hand the narration suggests a bow towards arthouse cinema, on the other the coverage stylistically has that commercial highly polished film look to it.\n\nLet me start by saying this film will not be to everyone taste ... During my screening 4 people left the cinema, but not because the film is bad, it\'s just because it has certain visual style and extreme intensity, which some viewers might find overwhelming.\n\nPersonally I think Coralie Fargeat is brilliant, just like Gaspar Noé she is a filmmaker, which is not afraid of taking risks, exploring new avenues of artistic expression in medium of cinema.\n\nNarratively the movie has this synopsis:\n\n""A fading celebrity decides to use a black market drug, a cell-replicating substance that temporarily creates a younger, better version of herself""\n\nAt age 61 Demi Moore makes here tremendously successful, brave comeback to the limelight. Not only because she showcases plenty of her nudity, but being able to dig deep in her subconscious, being naked emotionally, as well as being fearless, making herself look absolutely disgusting.\n\nIf this movie wouldn\'t be body horror I would say her performance deserve Oscar Nomination, sadly horror movies are often snubbed in nominations as horror genre lowers vibrational frequency of the body through fear emotion.\n\nMargaret Qualley former ballet dancer delivers star making performance as a younger version of Demi Moore, which with her grace and charm is able to hypnotize the audience in to self worship .\n\nDennis Quaid who replaced late Ray Liota delivers very two faced sleazy performance as TV exacutive which is obsessed with youthfulness and power.\n\nHowever where the movie excels the most is the filmmaking aspect. The camera work is superb and in fact this film needs to be seen by all directors of photography, as it is breaking the canon of how theatrical films are normally shot.\n\nCoralie uses an extreme closeups very frequently to the point that the whole aspect of macro-micro of the world is stating to bland in. Her choice of macro lenses can sometime make the audience feel emotionally drained (this is why some people leave the screening), but as she uses this technique it has narrative purpose more then just being a visual candy. Often framing things in the middle DP uses vanishing point to enhance depth in the frame.\n\nAlso use fisheye lenses in close ups distorts the actors making them less attractive.\n\nThe sound design is superb bringing the aspect of horror to full emotion impact. And again this film should be showcased in film school to teach students how to use sound design for enchantment of what is happening onscreen.\n\nUltimately\'THE SUBSTANCE\' is a journey through surrealism, but kept in commercialized visual coverage, with heavy emphasis on body horror specially in act 3 where things go really extreme.\n\nThink of this film as if surrealism of David Lynch and David Cronenberg body horror, had a monster baby and Gaspar Noä and Brian De Palma (the bloody act 3 heavily influenced by \'Carrie\') were the godparents.\n\nHighly disturbing and yet groundbreaking at the same time \'THE SUBSTANCE\' will have the power to polarize the audiences with some, loving the movie, others will feel sense of disgust. Occasionally deeply comedic, this is a brave, risk-taking cinema, which isn\'t there to be pleasant for the viewer, but instead it is an impactful journey in to exploration of worship of fame and commercialized youth obsessed couture of mainstream entertainment industry. Coralie Fargeat you did so well here, keep being brave in paving new pathways in to cinema language vocabulary.\n\nHighly recommended for viewers with high intellectual and emotional depth!!!', ""This mishmash of countless cinematic influences-does a good job most of the time but eventually betrays it's own rules and lacks logic.\n\nHow can the two bodies be one when it's very clear that they're two different personalities? At first you get the impression that you got one mind sharing two different bodies but all of a sudden it changes and they start fighting each other.\n\nAnother thing: Doesn't Demi Moore have any friends, family, or boyfriends? Apart from a couple of male douches there is less social interaction here than in The Omega Man.\n\nThis one ain't as stupid as Titane but there are some serious credibility issues.\n\nThe science that makes this possible does not make much sense in the same way a Cronenberg film does.\n\nBTW, where was it shot? Its supposed to be Hollywood but if it was shot there, the director sure did a bad job. You don't see a single location whatsoever, just the top of some palm trees. UPDATE : It was shot in France!\n\nAt least it delivers gore in spades but last scenes are too far fetch. It seems they didn't know where to stop.\n\nThere also seems to be an anti-meat message in there somewhere. Something about anorexia and veganism. The message behind the movie seems to be that if you're not happy with how you look, just take it easy, things could have been worse. Also every male is a douche or a loser. The scene with the piece of paper that lands in the dirty water and Demi More picks it up, wants to show us something about these characters, but let's face it, it doesn't ring real. Does the director expect us to believe that character of Demi Moore would give a toss about such a loser?"", ""There is a need to suspend disbelief throughput The Substance which runs 2 hours 20 and seems a little long as it drifts around looking at ageism in tv and film. The Substance takes a sci-fi / horror approach and there was a fair bit of laughing in my audience, and I'm not sure that was generally because of well placed jokes. Demi Moore is very good as Elisabeth Sparkle, a mature tv aerobics instructor who is in great shape, but sacked by a revolting tv executive (Dennis Quaid) and replaced by young and perky Sue (Margaret Qualley), but whose show is basically the same. Angry and frustrated, Elisabeth takes a mysterious Substance in a bid to regain her youth and career.\n\nIronically Moore has had a bit of work over the years which led me to wonder if she now regrets that, or is it the price one pays for success in film snd tv or the business world in general. The Substance seems to borrow some of its imagery from 2001: A space Odyssey and Little Shop of Horrors. In the end I suspect this may garner a cult following. Its good fun in its quirky weirdness."", 'The Substance marks the return of body horror, a genre that was almost forgotten but now resurfaces with force in the mainstream. The film is good, cinematographically above the current average, and stands out for not succumbing to softness: it\'s disgusting and delivers quality gore. The French director - naturally European - draws from various sources to shape her work, such as Black Swan, The Shining, Possession, and especially the classics of David Cronenberg, who would surely appreciate this film.\n\nThe beginning is highly creative. The two introductions, first of the substance and then of the protagonist, are short and clever. The opening scene, showcasing the ""product,"" is brilliant and sets the tone for what\'s to come: centralized direction, artificial lighting, wide-angle shots, and a soundtrack that mixes electronic and classical music create the perfect atmosphere of discomfort. The caricatured supporting cast and set compositions further reinforce the idea that we\'re watching science fiction.\n\nDemi Moore delivers a top-tier performance, particularly in her physical acting, while Margaret Qualley, portraying the ""other side"" of her character, keeps the bar high. The film\'s aggressiveness is one of its standout elements: close-ups of injections, exposed wounds, decaying bodies, and peeling skin all culminate in a tragicomic climax that highlights the grotesque lyricism of the work.\n\nAlthough it\'s not disturbing enough to traumatize, the film does feel uncomfortable in some scenes. It\'s long and repetitive, divided into four extensive acts that drag out the conclusion. Some sequences seem to have been added later, like afterthoughts during post-production. While this doesn\'t ruin the experience, it does make it more tiresome than necessary.\n\nOne of the film\'s greatest merits is its critical edge, addressing issues like ageism, sexualization, and renewal. The director explores these themes through horror without forcing dialogues or expository scenes. There\'s a bit of that, but nothing that disrupts the flow. The work can be appreciated as both a horror film, which works very well, and as a science fiction piece that, despite sometimes feeling like a patchwork of ideas, ultimately holds up as an artistic expression of the grotesque.\n\nFor fans of 80s-style trash body horror, The Substance is a treat. Rating: 8/10.', 'This movie was awesome! It\'s starts off like something really serious, dark and very on point and slowly it grows into something new, the hope of Elizabeth to become what she used to be at her prime, but also the fact that she has to stay aware life is still going on and living through somebody else is not what she needs because it will just get her jealous of the new self that has everything she wants to experience all over again. Her ""both-selves"" have to live together but they don\'t follow the rules and they start to become a poison to one another in their own way, until their downfall... The end of the movie is really different from the rest but still very accurate because it goes way deeper in the spiraling end the substance lead them to. I\'d say the 30-20 mins at the end of the movie can seem too much for some people that would take the movie too seriously but it really gives the horrific vibe it\'s supposed to give to anyone that would face this situation and in my opinion it was just the cherry on top of the cake 😂 I would say that it feels like Cronenberg made the end of the movie but I really liked it that way!', ""An aging celebrity uses a mysterious black-market a cell-replicating substance that creates a younger, enhanced version of herself with dire consequences.\n\nDirector Coralie Fargeat's socially aware body horror gives David Cronenberg and Brian Yuzna a run for their money.

Excellent performances, Kubrick-like visuals, and on-location shooting ground the film's brilliant graphic special effects.\n\nBenjamin Kracun's cinematography, paired with Fargeat's stylish production and direction, delivers an intriguing and unforgettable film.

She is putting a lot into this Hollyweird satire. It digs hard especially casting former Hollywood A-lister Demi Moore. This is the perfect role for her and probably for Margaret Qualley as well. Qualley is travelling a similar trajectory as Demi although maybe not as tabloid worthy. This film allows Demi to exorcise some real world demons. I do have a problem with the length of the movie. The middle part feels slower by comparison. She could have faced more challenges in that section. Her packages could be stolen or a serum could break. It needs something external. In the end, it is self-sabotage and that's not as exciting. It is rather poignant, but Sue is also rather dumb. I guess it's like an addiction.

Highly recommended.', '""The Substance"" strikes a compelling balance between homage and imitation, weaving in visual and thematic echoes of cult 80s horror films while sparking debates about originality in modern cinema. The glowing yellow substance recalls the reanimation serum from Re-Animator, embodying the same mysterious and transformative allure. The visceral body modifications and surreal scenes call back to Cronenberg\'s aesthetic in Videodrome and eXistenZ, with grotesque beauty and organic-mechanical hybrids pushing boundaries.\n\nThe monstrous transformation of Elizabeth draws parallels to Basket Case, echoing the tragic horror of malformed beings, and the grotesque degeneration in The Toxic Avenger. ElisaSue\'s blue dress even feels like a cheeky nod to Toxie\'s pink dress, symbolizing human identity eroded by monstrous evolution.\n\nWhile the film brims with nostalgic references, it stumbles under their weight, sometimes feeling derivative rather than groundbreaking. As a viewer, I found myself torn between admiration for its technical craft and frustration at its lack of distinctiveness. Can The Substance carve out its place among the classics it reveres?

But then it turned from a decent story to an incredible splatter festival with absolutely no sense and credibility. I can only tell everyone: don\'t get caught by the positive reviews, save your money and don\'t go to see this junk. The actors are good (maybe a bit too much from Dennis Quaid) and the basic idea of the story is great. Unfortunately the last 1/3 of the movie seemed like some gore-fans sat together and everybody had even better ideas of how to ""shock"" the audience.', 'When I first saw Coralie Fargeat\'s The Substance, I couldn\'t have dreamed that this would be the most controversial entry on my list. Surely it is obvious to everyone that this is about as good as it gets in terms of expressive/creative cinematography, set design, makeup, and acting -- even if you aren\'t as much of an irremediable fan of cartoonish gore as I am?\n\nAlas, after a whole bunch of praise during its theatrical run, the film was met with scorn after it became more widely viewable. (Weird how certain movies get worse reviews when people who watch movies on their laptops instead of watching them in an auditorium start getting access to them. I suspect that\'s just as much of an issue as popularity making things cool to hate.) The big talking point has been the film\'s various horror homages, including call-backs to Cronenberg, Kubrick, Hitchcock, Bergman, and even shlock like Basket Case and Braindead, and the question was: Is there really a purpose to them?\n\nI concede that some of them seem mainly aesthetic (even though I\'ve come around on the call-backs to The Shining, which, according to one critic, seem to distill the entertainment industry into a sort of glammy Overlook Hotel with all its accursed ""loops""), but why worry when the end result is this colossally gorgeous? As for the complaints about the subtlety and tact of the themes, I\'d say those come down to an inability to ""meet the film where it is"", to quote a mutual on Twitter, instead of imagining what YOU think the film should be. This is a consistently over-the-top, purposely on-the-nose body horror comedy with French Extremist sensibilities; to whine about obvious, in-your-face satire is to complain about cats in Garfield.\n\nA more understandable complaint regards Demi Moore\'s character; how the film seems to poke fun at those who try to play by the system\'s rules just as much as the system itself. But to acknowledge that shallow women exist isn\'t to blame women for the way beauty-obsessed industries operate. It is a film about self-hatred, and it captures self-hatred all too well.\n\nAnd of course, I would agree that all the swooning and fancamming over the conventionally attractive Margaret Qualley -- instead of her just as monumental co-star Demi Moore -- is a sign that a lot of people missed the point. If you think that\'s Fargeat\'s fault and not the morons who missed the point, well, maybe you\'ll at least want to retract those ""it was too obvious"" complaints.', 'Fountain of Youth tales go back centuries, as do stories of Hollywood valuing physical attractiveness and vigor. French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat goes at those themes with a vengeance in THE SUBSTANCE (which she also wrote).\n\nElizabeth Sparkle is an Oscar winning actress who\'s had a second career as an Exercise and Fitness guru on a long-running TV show (shades of Jane Fonda). When she hits the big 5-0, her piggish Producer (Dennis Quaid) named Harvey (wink, wink) decides it\'s time to put her out to pasture. After a medical procedure, a handsome Nurse (Robin Greer) slips her a note with a phone number about a mysterious potion that will change her life - The Substance. Desperate, Elizabeth contacts the clandestine outfit and goes through the process. Shazam! Elizabeth spawns a gorgeous doppelganger dubbed Sue (Margaret Qualley). The catch is that the two halves can\'t co-exist: Elizabeth must be dormant while Sue is dominant, and vice-versa. They are self-vampires.\n\nFargeat and her team have made a sharp looking picture. Stanislas Reydellet\'s production design emphasizes the isolation of the Elizabeth/Sue hybrid. It\'s all long corridors and large, mostly empty, stark spaces. A huge Picture of Dorian Grey-like portrait of a youthful Elizabeth looms over the main living area. Benjamin\'s Kracun\'s cinematography is appropriately cold and sleek, while Raffertie\'s music booms and bounces (quoting Bernard Herrmann\'s VERTIGO and Strauss\' ""Thus Spake Zarathustra""- is not entirely successful). The book-ended prologue and epilogue are spot on.\n\nFargeat\'s screenplay has a number of darkly witty moments and certainly hits its satirical targets concerning beauty, fame and vanity. It\'s a stroke of genius to cast Moore as the lead here as she has certainly been the object of much discussion about aging in Tinseltown, wearing her own plastic surgery as visible reminders of the pressures of maintaining those impossible standards. She\'s excellent, but it would be remiss to not mention that Qualley more than holds her own. Unfortunately, the movie mostly runs out of steam halfway through. It\'s few observations aren\'t so much expanded upon as repeated over and over.\n\nPart of the issue here is the symbiotic Jekyll and Hyde nature is split into two distinct bodies. The mechanics of The Substance inherently work against the psychological possibilities here. The covert entity behind the product keeps insisting that Elizabeth and Sue ""are one"", but they rarely share the screen, instead opting for the pair to mutter under their breath about how the other is ruining their individual life. Further, Fargeat further isolates the pair by having so few supporting characters. Neither Elizabeth nor Sue seem to have any friends, relatives or work confidantes. They literally have ""no life"" (clearly part of the script\'s plan, but not very edifying nor dramatic). Harvey is a garish cartoon figure as are the other all male authority figures - they make the Mattel execs in BARBIE seem like well rounded gentlemen by comparison. Having even one female person in charge (or as an enabler) would have added some much needed layering to the satire. Fargeat instead opts for base parody.\n\nBy the time Fargeat tries to top Norma Desmond\'s fall from sanity, the movie has exhausted itself - and, yet lingers on for another 20 minutes or so. The makeup effects (by Olivier Afonso and team) are very well done and there\'s nothing inherently wrong with extreme body horror but it all overstays its welcome. David Cronenberg has long been looked upon as the master of this sub-genre and for good reason - he understands that pulp should be swift and to the point (there are several specific allusions to his version of THE FLY here). A more recent example is the Cannes Award winning TITANE by Julia Ducourneau. THE SUBSTANCE is a fascinating and entertaining film. It\'s also hard to dislike a movie too much that depicts snow in Los Angeles!', 'I had high hopes for this movie after I saw the 15 minute standing ovation at Cannes that the film received as well as the press interviews I\'d seen the cast do. I set my mind to an open state because I knew it was ""different"" based on everything I\'d read and watched about the movie.\n\nThis movie definitely has a very strong message about our obsession with youth and it makes that point on so many levels. It\'s so graphic and so over the top that I can see why reviewers will call this an instant cult classic.\n\nMy suggestions to anyone who hasn\'t seen it yet, to go in with an open mind and don\'t expect a dramatic/psycho/horror type film. This is not that. This is of its own category. It does it\'s job and I left the theater a new fan of Coralie Fargeat. I\'m so interested to see what she does next.\n\nDemi Moore is a class act and does a fantastic job in this film and Margaret Qualley plays the hell out of this role and gives us lots of eye candy.', 'I had no clue how incredible of an actress Demi Moore is. I cant remember her in anything. I am blow away by her performance in this movie. Dennis Quaid and Margaret Qualley are amazing too. I havent been left with this uneasy feeling from a horror since I saw the exorcist when I was little. I highly recommend watching this if you appreciate good horror films. I would have liked to learn a bit more about the origin of the substance but I dont believe that was the main focus of the film. I am truly blown away.\n\nThe makeup and suit design were just insanely well done. The cinemetography and sound was on a whole different level. My brain could not handle some parts but I pushed through and I am glad I did. Really, bravo on this performance. Well done all around.', ""The Substance is an absolute trip. Coralie Fargeat delivers a slick, grotesque commentary on our obsession with youth, turning the vanity of Hollywood into a nightmare you can't look away from-even when you want to.\n\nDemi Moore and Margaret Qualley are perfectly cast, playing off each other as two sides of the same, warped coin. The film's satirical edge and surreal visuals hit hard, even if the final act spirals into chaos. Just when you think the film has hit its peak in squeamishness, an even more depraved visual lurks just around the corner. Love it or hate it, The Substance is an experience you won't forget."", ""This movie was SH0CKlNG...it was Terrifier 2 level shock....so if u can't wait for Terrifier 3, this should quench your thirst...The audience reactions were awesome!

Very good rating for an horror movie too.', ""This is without doubt one of the worst movies i have ever sat through. The performances by all concerned are fine but the whole concept is so dumb it beggars belief.\n\nI can't see why it is getting any praise at all. The make-up effects are good, but not great, in fact the standard drops as the film progresses, the last twenty minutes or so being downright awful.\n\nWhere are the great visuals and editing mentioned by so many? Where is the strong feminine message? How on earth can you possibly compare this badly paced, ill conceived fiasco with the works of Cronenberg or Kubrick?\n\nIf this is genuinely being considered one of the best films of the year then modern cinema is in a truly terrible state.\n\nAvoid."", '""The Substance"" follows Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore), a renowned fitness TV star whose career (and life) comes crashing down on her 50th birthday when her boss, Harvey (Dennis Quaid), calls it quits on her long-running series. Through a chance encounter, Elisabeth learns of a mysterious black market substance that claims to replicate her DNA, leading to the birth of a second, ""newer, better"" version of herself. Desperate, Elisabeth takes the gamble, giving life to Sue (Margaret Qualley). The two selves must trade off in seven day intervals (leaving the other in a comatose state), but maintaining this balancing act proves troublesome, leading to disastrous consequences.\n\nWhile I enjoy body horror films, it is not necessarily my favorite sub-genre, but I had fairly high hopes for ""The Substance"" with a few reservations. I walked out of the theater nearly speechless. It may be the best horror film I\'ve seen this year, and there have been a lot of great ones thus far. While ""The Substance"" is certainly not for all tastes, it is a film that has a little bit of everything. It\'s gruesome and ghastly, but it\'s also at times jet-black humorous. There is action, gore, dance sequences, car crashes, blood-soaked fights and broken glass, and more than a few interior visual homages to Stanley Kubrick\'s ""The Shining"". There are even audacious special effects pieces that rival (and recall) the bonkers creations of Screaming Mad George (see Brian Yuzna\'s ""Society"" for reference), something I never in a million years could have imagined I\'d see on display in a movie starring Demi Moore.\n\nAnd yet, behind all the monstrous spectacle and bloody entrails, ""The Substance"" also has thematic weight that renders the film\'s more violent elements an emotional dimension that is at times painful to watch. At its core, this film is a parable on self-loathing. Yes, there is a strong commentary on beauty standards (particularly those of women) and the corporate machines that power (and distort) the images we have of ourselves. When you boil it down, though, this is a story that has a universal appeal because the nature of it is very much human.\n\nVisually, the film has a hyperreal look and smart, effective pacing that leaves its 2 hour and 20 minute-runtime feeling like a breeze. A film like this would not work without competent performers, and we get that in droves from Demi Moore here. Nobody has ever seen her in a film like this, and she gives a gung-ho performance that hits the emotional beats just as expertly as the grotesque. Margaret Qualley is her counterpoint as Sue, and matches Moore on both of these levels, as the two women (or rather, one--an important distinction in the plot) do a sort of dance that is part ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde"", part ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"". Dennis Quaid rounds out the principal cast here as Moore\'s (and later, Qualley\'s) boss, a gross pastiche of the slimiest of slimiest entertainment executives.\n\nThe film ramps up in the last act in a way that I didn\'t exactly see coming. I expected a credit roll after a few key moments, but no--Coralie Fargeat kept pushing. I can only describe the finale as a perverse collision of something like ""Ziegfeld Girl"" and the climax of ""Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II"", but in all truth, I\'m not sure I\'ve seen anything quite like it before.\n\nIn the end, though, I cannot help but feel that the most harrowing and powerful sequence in the film is a protracted, brutal physical battle between the two leading women, which serves as a distillation of everything it is speaking to. Underneath all the blood, the teeth, the bone, and every pound of flesh, ""The Substance"" is really an agonizing portrait of just how much we can hate ourselves--and more importantly, the price we pay for doing so. 10/10.', 'Whoever\'s disappointed by the ending deluded themselves into thinking they were watching a different movie. It is raw, it is in your face, it is overacted, it is absurd, and it all *works* because it is also exceedingly honest both to itself and the viewer.\n\nThere wasn\'t a single moment throughout where my eyes weren\'t glued to the screen; the visuals and plot beats are gripping, fascinating, edge of your seat. The ending sequence was delightful and made me think ""oh they are *going* there aren\'t they"". Because yes, it could\'ve gone a different, more demure and depressing route, but it also would have been the more predictable ""been there, done that"" route. All in all I think the movie had an amazing idea and perfect execution; what more could you ask for.', ""For her first film since her underrated debut in 2017 with Revenge, French director Coralie Fargeat has hit the big time with her much talked about body-horror hit The Substance.\n\nWinner of this years Cannes Film Festival Best Screenplay award and sure to be a major player in the soon too arrive awards season that will take over the industry for the foreseeable future, it's not hard too see why Fargeat's confronting and unrelenting experience has managed to find itself as a key player of the 2024 feature film crop.\n\nClocking in at close to two and a half hours in length, The Substance explores the life of Demi Moore's aging starlet Elizabeth Sparkle, who has turned to an off-market and highly dubious product that will see her magically age backwards with a whole other version of herself that she must share her time with on a one week on and one week off basis.\n\nIt's a fairly wild concept that does shares DNA with other body horror/body swap films in the horror cannon but thanks to a large swathe of reasons Fargeat is able to ensure that The Substance's visceral representations of all the ideas and concepts at play here are unlike anything you've seen before with the film loaded with a range of things you'd never think you were going to see, creating a viewing experience that is tailor made for the shared cinema option if you can so arrange.\n\nUnafraid to get seriously demented and twisted (who would've thought the mere act of eating some seafood could be so disgusting?), The Substance may not have something entirely new to say and is arguably fairly self-indulgent to give itself such a large runtime to say what it wants to but there's a lot here to enjoy from Fargeat's colourful direction, composer Raffertie's moody score, wickedly good practical effects and most importantly two awards worthy turns from its leads who have never been better.\n\nAt one time one of Hollywood's biggest stars, Moore in particular has come out of nowhere to deliver what should be a lead turn that is in the conversation for Oscar recognition with her iteration of Sparkle a sad, confronting and realistic examination of ones quest to remain relevant and youthful.\n\nA grounded presence in a film that increasingly becomes less and less grounded as it goes along its way, steamrolling to a divisive final act that will alienate some viewers and enrapture others, Moore should be heading into what's hopefully another successful era of her otherwise recently quiet career while her co-star Margaret Qualley only grows in stature with her work here as the captivating Sue, a ball of energy who starts to resent the fact she has to give herself up on regular intervals to a much more weathered and fragile older self.\n\nUnquestionably not for everyone with some frantic swings here that don't always hit, The Substance is a quality new addition to the body-horror subgenre and a fantastic Hollywood calling card for its director and timely reminder to all of the talents of its leading lady.\n\nFinal Say -\n\nPrepare to be shocked, The Substance is a trip unlike any other. An unashamedly bonkers exploration of human beings and their quest to remain relevant and youthful, Coralie Fargeat's sophomore feature is sure to be a film to watch out for come awards season.\n\n3 1/2 shrimp out of 5.\n\nJordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"", 'On the day that the actress Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore) is fifty years old, her former successful career downfalls and the producer Harvey (Dennis Quaid) call her show off, telling her that he needs a new face on TV. The upset Elisabeth drives home and is distracted by the removal of the billboard of her TV show and is hit by a truck. She wakes up in the hospital and the male nurse gives a flash drive to her with the title ""The Substance"". When she arrives home, she watches the video about a substance that would split her in two, with a more perfect and beautiful younger version of her. But there is a rule, their time will be shared, and they will not coexist. One week Elisabeth lives, the other week her new version lives without exception. In principle reluctant, Elisabeth decides to use the substance. She generates a gorgeous woman that goes to the audition to be the substitute for Elisabeth\'s show. When they ask her name, she says Sue (Margaret Qualley) and is immediately hired by Harvey. Elisabeth and Sue live seven days each in principle taking care of the dormant one, feeding each other in accordance with the rules. But although being just one, the washed-up Elisabeth feels jealous of Sue\'s success while her younger version wants to live more than seven days to enjoy life. Soon their feelings bring tragic consequences.\n\n""The Substance"" (2024) is one of the most (if not the most) original films recently released by the cinema industry. Coralie Fargeat, from ""Revenge"" (2017), wrote and directs a unique movie that blends several genres and works perfectly well. The plot shows the drama of many actresses in Hollywood when they reach fifty years old, and the roles disappear. It shows a cartoonish producer named Harvey and being responsible for most of the funny lines and situations. The ambition of new actresses in the business, represented by Sue. And lots of gore, recalling Peter Jackson\'s ""Braindead"" (1992). The special effects are amazing and gruesome, and the performance of Demi Moore is impressive and outstanding and deserves a nomination for the Oscar. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): ""A Substância"" (""The Substance"")', 'This movie was great.\n\nTruly disgusting in parts, and also quite hilarious in others. I burst out laughing a few times.\n\nI was excited to see this movie when I initially read the premise.

It was like a fever dream nightmare scene; completely ludicrous.\n\nSome people comment that they feel the ending ruined the movie. I give the Director props- she really leaned into the ridiculous here.\n\nI must praise Demi Moore. She went all out in this film. She gave everything she had, and considering how absurd some of this film is, she never faltered. She was totally convincing.\n\nShe was the shining star of the movie in my mind. The other actors and actresses were great, but I feel she really went to another level.\n\nIf you are a fan of body horror this is a must watch film.', ""I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Surprised also by the fact that Demi Moore plays in a horror movie, not really the genre we are used to from her. And even if it's not really a scary story the bloody parts are pretty gore and well shot. I thought the cinematography was excellent, with many various close-up shots of good quality. Margaret Qualley and Demi Moore (even after her horrible body modifications) are eye candy, pleasant to look at. Dennis Quaid only has a minor role in this movie but was certainly convincing in playing his character. All in all The Substance is worth watching, certainly if you like a bit of gore.""]",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/a-substancia/7fcc65d8-a3d2-447c-8d04-144600a488fc.webp

I'm actually glad that I did because it's a very interesting and beautiful film visually speaking. Like most Burroughs stories there will be characters involved in heavy drug use and so I was aware of that and kind of expecting much of the story to be told through a characters drug hazed/influenced/induced eyes. That can be tricky as much of the story is expressed via metaphors and odd/quirky/hard to decipher visuals. In Queer that all worked quite well and while I anticipated possibly leaving the theatre confused and wondering, I actually left satisfied. Trent Reznor produced all of the music and I think he did a bang-on job with most of the music really hitting the nail on the head for me emotionally. As for the performances, Craig turned in a very solid performance on a role that was a tricky one to pull off but I think he did indeed pull it off quite well. Jason Schwartzman was great and his character provided some much needed levity to this film. All of the remaining characters were all solid supporters and contributors. Guadagnino's direction was well executed and i will say seeing a few of his that he does have a special way of blending the camera, with the lighting, and the music so perfectly during the lighter and more tender moments of his films to really generate a vibe, yet without being too obvious soas to smother the moment. I do think the third part in the jungle could have benefitted from some prudent editing as I felt like it went on a bit too long, or maybe it didn't really need to take actually take place in a jungle at all? Something to consider. Queer is not an 'easy' film to watch and it will not be for everyone. Either way, I was pleasantly surprised by how effective, interesting, amd moving Queer was and consider it well worth checking out."", ""The chemistry in this film is unreal.\n\nWhat a beautiful film by Guadagnino about desire as something transcendental and, at the same time, a burden.\n\nA film that beautifully captures a story rich in almost supernatural eroticism about bodies and touches.\n\nI'm happy to see this film, but it's not for everyone, especially those who don't want to embrace all the narrative's curveballs.\n\nWith a mysterious ending and sex scenes that may seem exaggerated to some prudes, Guadagnino is one of the few greats working who hasn't given up on lust as an instrument in his stories, and that's beautiful.\n\nQueer shows an extraordinary capture through sound design and hallucinatory representation of how sex is such a powerful experience for humans and a fundamental part of being human that it cannot be omitted from stories due to the public's complacency, Queer challenges you.\n\nThe art direction and photography are excellent, with beautiful scene composition and excellent acting. Daniel Craig can break your heart by doing very little and Queer seems to be just another stage on this new journey alongside Knives Out of someone who wants to be more than an iconic 007."", 'The main reason is that the film was too abstract and seemed like a stream of consciousness. The general meaning is to explore the loneliness in the queer heart, the difficulty in establishing connections with others, the pain of not being able to love, and the complex emotions of depression. But the performance technique is very stream-of-consciousness, especially the last 20 minutes, which have almost no lines and are completely used to express the inner world of the male protagonist through various blurs, hallucinations, and abstract art forms. Although I understood what the director wanted to express, the form of expression may not be acceptable to the public, and I wanted to leave the scene at one point.', 'QUEER. This word has more than one meaning. The most widespread is ""odd or strange."" The second most common usage is ""homosexual."" Both meanings apply to this film, but the first meaning is probably more apt. This movie has far more in common with APOCALYPSE NOW than with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The story concerns ""Lee,"" a man in his early 50s in the 1950s. He\'s an American who has achieved a certain level of material success and is now living a relatively hedonistic expat life in Mexico. He is an alcoholic and is in the early stages of drug addiction. He spends his days and nights prowling the gay bars and having meaningless liaisons with men he has nothing in common with, except that they are homosexuals. It is an empty existence. What does he want? He wishes he knew. He cannot put it into words. He meets a younger man who seems to be bisexual (his companion in the bar scene is female), but they develop a relationship. It is not particularly satisfying to him. He wants more from the younger man than the younger man is willing to give. He finally talks him into accompanying him on a trip to the South American jungles to search for a plant containing a drug that allegedly will enable him to develop telepathic powers. He believes that this drug will enable him to understand what he wants without resorting to words. He is told that there is a female shaman in the jungle who can obtain the plant for him. The two men go into the jungle and do indeed find the woman, who, as played by Lesley Manville, is a ferocious force-a knife-wielding, gun-toting old gal who seems bloodthirsty. They at least partially win her trust, but she warns them against taking the drug. It will open a door that they will not be able to close.\n\nI\'m glad I saw this movie, but it\'s not for everybody. The ending is enigmatic and the gay sex scenes may be a little too specific for some people. It\'s not quite hard-core pornography, but, thanks mostly to sound effects, does come close. And the drug-induced hallucinations could be really upsetting to some people, too.\n\nThis film is gorgeous to look at; the art direction and cinematography are outstanding, with every scene beautifully composed. To me it was evocative of the paintings of Edward Hopper in its depiction of an objective isolation of the psyche. The acting is also outstanding. Daniel Craig can break your heart by doing very little. I predict that both he and Lesley Manville will get Oscar nominations-Manville may win in the Supporting Actress category. It wasn\'t until I saw her name on the end credits that I realized that this was the same actress who played the title role in MRS HARRIS GOES TO PARIS. This is a great performance.\n\nI think this film will become a staple on the art house circuit. It certainly deserves more than one viewing.', 'Greetings again from the darkness. Some filmmakers have earned the benefit of the doubt to the point where each film they release is worthy of consideration. Luca Guadagnino is one such filmmaker. He first captured my attention with I AM LOVE (2009) and has since followed that with such interesting films as A BIGGER SPLASH (2015), CALL ME BY YOUR NAME (2017), SUSPIRIA (2018), BONES AND ALL (2022), and CHALLENGERS, his first film released in 2024. This time he and his CHALLENGERS screenwriter, Justin Kuritzkes, take on the 1985 William S Burroughs novella, ""Queer"", which was linked to his 1953 novel, ""Junkie"". Taking on the writing of William S Burroughs is challenging enough as a reader, much less as a filmmaker.\n\nDaniel Craig stars as William Lee. If you are familiar with Burroughs\' writing, then you are aware the character of William Lee shares many of the same personal attributes as Burroughs himself. He\'s a gay man who drinks too much, does hard drugs, and is quite sexually promiscuous. The film opens with Chapter 1: How do you like Mexico? Lee spends his time drinking non-stop and carousing for his next roll in the proverbial hay. He has a few fellow ex-pat friends, including Joe Guidry (Jason Schwartzman), but it\'s a certain cool cat that catches his eye. Eugene Allerton (Drew Starkey) is a young ex-soldier and Lee is quickly enamored.\n\nThe two hang out together, although Lee is never really certain if Eugene is gay or not since he spends much of his time playing chess with fellow bar patron, Mary (Andra Ursula). One night of passion between Lee and Eugene leads to Chapter 2: Travel Companions. The two men make their way to South America as their awkward relationship (and agreement) leads to more booze. Chapter 3: The Botanist in the Jungle is certainly one of the most bizarre segments of any movie this year, as the men hike deep in the jungle to connect with a doctor who has researched some \'vegetation\' that may solve Lee\'s fascination/obsession with telepathy. There is no viable description for this segment, but kudos to anyone who recognizes Leslie Manville - the one who has a pet sloth and keeps a viper for home security.\n\nThe Epilogue picks up two years later, and it\'s here where Lee\'s long struggle with loneliness becomes most apparent. His time with Eugene provides home of a true, lasting relationship with something other than a tequila bottle or a heroin needle. Daniel Craig and Drew Starkey are both excellent here, and may each receive awards consideration. If your previous exposure to Mr. Craig is through the James Bond movies, you might find this role a bit surprising, but those who have followed his career are in the know.\n\nOpening in theaters on December 6, 2024.', '""I\'m not queer. I\'m disembodied.""\n\nIncredibly faithful adaptation of William S Burroughs\' QUEER gives way to a haunting, melancholic, surreal romance film that goes further than just being Carol for the boys with the focus on existentialism, addiction, communication, bodies, dreams, and memories. This reminds me more of Apichatpong Weerasethakul\'s haunting and magical realist films. On top of having a phenomenal score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, with an unforgettable piano and woodwind theme motif (""Pure Love"" track) and credits song ""Vaster than Empires"" that references Burroughs\' memoirs (""How can a man who sees and feels be other than sad""). There are some other fantastic and anachronistic needle drops, particularly involving Nirvana and Verdana\'s ""Puzzle"". The fivesome team of Justin Kuritzkes, Luca Guadagnino, Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, Trent Reznor, and Atticus Ross deliver an even stronger best film of the year than Challengers, especially when it comes to emotional resonance. I was teary-eyed by the end, and the book never even took me there. The racist edges of Burroughs\' characters are sanded off here but this is still about privileged American immigrants drifting about in \'50s Mexico and some slurs are still casually thrown out of their mouths and a lot of the dialogue is lifted directly from the book. Jason Schwartzman as Joe in heavy makeup and fat suit as the chubby comedic relief almost steals the scenes he\'s in. Daniel Craig delivers an amazing Oscar-worthy performance but Drew Starkey as Eugene Allerton is no slouch either, and their aching body language speaks more than any of the words which are often mumbled anyway, particularly a recurring thing of their cuddles and the legs over each other, or how Craig\'s Lee touches the back and ribs. The dreams have some unforgettable imagery that bolsters the haunting atmosphere, along with the astral projections of his hands reaching out as externalisations of Lee\'s desires. There is a memorable naked dance in Ecuador when they\'re on ayahuasca (yage) that reaches Cronenbergian levels as their bodies meld into each other. The centipede signifies the danger of this obsessive romance that has Lee going into teen-like giddy silliness and awkwardness as he pursues a young man and requesting for him to be nice to him twice a week. The painstakingly detailed props and mise en scene add a lot to the character of the sets and locations, and there are some fantastic uses of miniatures (Lee\'s eye looks into a hotel and sees himself) and painted backdrops that speaks to the surrealist tendencies, along with the unforgettable practical effects when they\'re high and vomiting scrotums containing organs. There is so much love and pain instilled into this film that it is easily one of Guadagnino\'s best and also possibly my favourite film of 2024.', ""In order to escape drug possession charges in the United States, the hero came to Mexico City and indulged himself. . . I also tried to write, but mostly wandered the streets, immersing myself in brothels, cockfights and bars. . . When he saw the lanky, bespectacled Eugene on the street, he was smitten. At first, their flirtatious glances were just a playful cat-and-mouse game. Lee's initial attempts at contact hit a wall, but Eugene gradually began to socialize with him in bars. But Eugene eventually left, and two years later, Lee returned to Mexico City, with these cryptic words lingering in a haunting coda, when the image of Eugene in his mind was pitted against Burroughs himself and Vollmer. That painful past is intertwined."", ""I have never seen 'Naked Lunch' (1991) but I found myself frequently thinking of it during the 2024 London Film Festival screening of 'Queer': probably to be expected, as William S Burroughs provided the source material for both films.\n\nIn 1950s' México, William Lee, an American writer on the wrong side of... forty? Fifty? Spends his days getting drunk, shooting up and having casual sex with other men. One day muscular, smart young hunk Eugene walks into the bar and Lee is smitten. But what does Eugene himself want? Plus there is that telepathic drug to think about...\n\nI am not sure what, stylistically, director Luca Guadagnino is trying to achieve with this film. The sets are decorated almost exclusively in block colours - dull reds and olive greens, for example - and have that vaguely unrealistic, clean, Technicolour look that made me think the intention is to homage the films of the era in which the film is set. But if that is the case, why the decidedly un-1950s rock- and techno soundtrack?\n\nDaniel Craig (is it my imagination or is he beginning to look like Sid James?) is hamstrung in the lead role by constantly having to declaim nonsense speeches in an accent clearly not his own. Drew Starkey is able to give a subtler performance as the manipulative Eugene, and certainly looks the preppy part. Lesley Manville is unrecognisable as a doctor living in the South American jungle - well done to the make-up team!\n\nThis is the kind of film that strikes me as being more about arty style than storytelling substance. It was okay to see once, but I shall not be watching it again."", ""Queer\n\nQueer is a film, adapted from a novella written by William S. Burroughs, depicting homosexual life in Mexico in the post-war setting of the early 1950s. The film presents themes of drug addiction, internal homosexual acceptance, unrequited love and journeys into self acceptance.\n\nLee, a middle aged man, spends his time drunk and high, amongst a cluster of other men. They are promiscuous, fun loving, hard drinking individuals that live in what seems like a very accepting culture. While in public there is some discretion, we witness graphic conversations of sexual adventures and expressing interesting in other men.\n\nAll this changes when Lee meets Gene, another ex soldier from the war. Gene is seen out with a woman, but also shows interest in Lee, mostly due to Lee's overt, drunken advances.\n\nThe audience is then taken on a journey of Lee expressing said interest, all while balancing his substance use, and experiencing a reticence in Gene. This is the 1950s, as I said, so learning to accept one's sexuality was more difficult as it is today in the 2020s. Unfortunately, this also derails slightly when Gene's irritation with Lee's addictions leads to a semi-caretaker role. Is this love, or just a man helping a man that he cares for?\n\nI found the film quite enjoyable watching all these feelings unfold and explode into a very surreal third act that it must be experienced to understand. The film includes graphic male nudity and sexual situations, so be warned if that is not for you. Regardless of the same sex relationships, this is a great film to experience for the above mentioned themes. I recommend it wholeheartedly."", ""Luca Guadagnino channels David Lynch in this bizarre, winding adaptation of Burroughs' novella. Although very faithful to its source material, this film's length, anachronistic soundtrack and uneven pacing will test one's patience. It's not until fairly late, that it all starts to resemble the director's entrancing craft.\n\nDaniel Craig is a puzzling choice for this protagonist and shockingly he pulls it off quite well. Whether in a state of banter or wonder or disgust, Craig is in top form here. His performance perfectly conveys the inner turmoil, isolation and loneliness that older gay men face. A complex man who is alternately fascinating and insufferable, Craig breathes life into him.\n\nThe film's first chapter feels the longest. But just when you think it's going to be entombed in a claustrophobic melodrama, we get a new journey in the second chapter and unspeakable but beautiful terror in the third chapter. Although the film can be dry and prosaic in the beginning, I would still take Guadagnino even when he gets off-message over many other directors. In the end, this is a thought-provoking and haunting piece of cinema. Recommended to open-minded viewers."", ""This is one of most boring and pretentious I have seen for years. Except for the sound track that tries to put some life in this otherwise contrived and obsolete story of an old gay men going through his depressing quest for a meaning to his life. Extremely slow paced, pseudo intellectual dialogs, caricatural depiction of gays in the 50's, the film appears like wanting to show how lost gay men were in these years.\n\nDaniel Craig plays the anti héros. Drug addict, sexually impotent, he floats in a unreal world, desperate to find an anchor. He is sad and pathetic.\n\nThe film can be seen as the trash version of the famous Luchino Visconti's masterpiece Death in Venice. It could have been called Death in Mexico .\n\nAfter the highly regarded Call me by your name, the director seems to err to produce a new work of value."", 'Were it not for the fact that it features an ex ""007"", I reckon this would be an almost instantly forgettable gay-themed drama that could easily be found on Dekkoo in a year to two. Anyway, Daniel Craig is the independently wealthy ""Lee"" and living in a Mexico City where in between tequila and heroine sessions, he tries to pick up young men. He\'s not a bad looker and so usually gets some entertainment (paid for, or otherwise) but then he spots an enigmatic young man who comes to their local bar to play chess with a red-headed woman. Intrigued, his usually effective introductions seem to fall on beautiful but disinterested eyes and ears, but he persists and soon manages to befriend student ""Eugene"" (Drew Starkey). Even though they drink and chat together, he still isn\'t sure if his new challenge is even eligible for some furious jogging. Indeed, the young man is so completely non-committal and tractable that it\'s impossible for him to be sure about almost anything about him. Napoleon brandy might help provide an answer, and it does - of sorts, but an extremely satisfactory one for the older man who is clearly becoming obsessed with a man who at best displays indifference to him. ""Lee"" isn\'t used to this sensation, but he simply has to have something more meaningful with this man. He cannot just be an another notch on the bedpost, and so he turns his mind to a trip round South America and to take a travelling companion. Why there? Well he\'s read of a secret plant that he believes both the KGB and CIA are using for it\'s famed telepathic powers. Perhaps if he finds it, he can reach into the very mind of his gorgeous antagonist? What the men do manage to find in the midst of the Ecuadorian jungle is Lesley Manville and at this point the wheels really came off for me. At the very end, the closing slide says ""William S. Burroughs\' Queer"" as if Luca Guadagnino was saying to us - \'don\'t blame me"". Sure there are some sex scenes, but they are all blink and you\'ll miss them (and in the trails anyway), so what are we actually left with? A story of an ageing drunk and a narcissistic young man playing a rather depressing form of ""cat and mouse"" meets ""house""? To be fair, Craig delivers strongly indeed, but to what end? His character has nowhere to go, and his range of dependencies are neither attractive nor especially plausible as the second half of the story enters the surreal in quite a desperate way. Starkey has very few meaningful lines and so relies on his perfectly man-scaped appearance to present a persona that is easy on the eye but not remotely troubling for the brain, and that\'s largely in keeping with the whole story that just lacks substance. It\'s bizarrely unfulfilling on just about every front and really quite characteristically impotent. There\'s simply nothing natural about it and as tale of flawed humanity goes, well so what - I didn\'t care. It looks good, sounds good and has an altogether polished finish to it, but like a meringue there\'s little to delve into.', 'I was quite curious to see this latest film by the maker of ""Call Me By Your Name."" Although interesting as a literary adaptation and rare ""gay theme"" movie with a big-name star, the film was problematic for me in a number of ways.\n\nFirst the good: the carefully crafted visuals, both sets and backgrounds; the fearless portrayals of people with desperation always nipping at their heels; Daniel Craig\'s total commitment to his very unpalatable role; the incandescent hotness of Drew Starkey.\n\nNext the not-so-good: the main defect here is that the film is too long. It overstays its welcome mainly through the accumulation of small excesses, the most prominent of which is the 5-minute scene devoted to Lee shooting up (should have been handled far more economically). The use of music is also problematic -- there are some weird choices and juxtapositions, and there is a tendency for the film to lean too hard on the music for support in certain portions, a sign that the underlying material could have been cut.\n\nIn between: Daniel Craig, as mentioned, gives his all to his role. But his role is exceedingly uncomfortable to watch... probably because it is so spot on. The intellectual posturing (often to impress a younger male), the arrogance of (at least some) wealth, the weird need to seem congenial in a transparently forced way, and of course his complete absorption in self destruction through drugs and booze. I\'m reminded of James Fox\'s Tony in Joseph Losey\'s ""The Servant"" except here the addict only circles the drain and doesn\'t fall in.\n\nIn sum, I found this movie rather painful on several levels, but I\'m glad I satisfied my curiosity and saw it through to the not-so-bitter end.', 'Queer: This film surprised me, I thought it was going to be about William Lee (Daniel Craig) hanging out in 1950s Mexico, drinking, injecting heroin and chasing after younger men. Well it was, but also much more. Touches of Magic Realism combine with dream and hallucination sequences to make this film just as esoteric as Naked Lunch. Naked Lunch was also written by William S. Buttoughs in which he was again represented by the character William Lee. In Queer, Lee has twin obsessions one being Eugene Allerton (Drew Starkey), who has just finished his military service and is also living in Mexico City, the second being finding yagé, a plant said to offer telepathic abilities to those who consume it. Though engaging in a relationship with Lee, Allerton is diffident towards him but agrees to go on an expedition into the amazon jungle to find the plant. There they meet the bizarre botanist Dr Cotter (Lesley Manville). A love story, a fantasy, a quest for a holy grail, a sort of Road Movie. Much drinking and drugging occurs along with Lee cruising before he hooks up with Allerton. There is a touch of David Lynch to some of the sequences along with what looks like two homages to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Directed by Luca Guadagnino from a screenplay by Justin Kuritzkes, based on the 1985 novella by William S. Burroughs. 8/10.', 'I recently finished the book ""Junky"" by William S. Burroughs (canonical sequel to his book ""Queer"") so I only found it fitting to go see this one in theaters as soon as I could.\n\nI\'ll start out with some of the positive aspects: Luca Guadagnino was an excellent choice for directing this film. He understands the visuals and character aspects of William S. Burroughs almost as well as the author himself. It\'s also gorgeously shot and full of highly satisfying surrealist visuals. The eroticism didn\'t hurt too much either. Lastly, Daniel Craig is perfectly cast as William Lee. He brings an odd yet very charming eccentricity to the table that feels almost reminiscent to Johnny Depp in the Hunter S. Thompson movies.\n\nThe not so great things: the film is almost consistently slow and tedious despite great performances and visuals. That\'s always highly disappointing to me when a film is already so surreal. It has no excuse to be boring. Lastly, some of the modern music choices clashed very, very hard with the film and made me wince a bit.\n\nIt\'s very queer, in both ways of course. Did I enjoy this film? I sort of did, yea.\n\nC+', 'Queer seeks to expose the complicated relationship between men. Society tends to lump men in categories in constant failed efforts to attempt to figure them out. This film points out a few realities of the male species. In a nut shell men are far more complicated than they are given credit for. The film starts out rather predictably. It\'s a far cry from what we know director Luca\'s work to be. Don\'t expect another ""Call Me By Your Name"" or anything close to it. It\'s different and it will take you to a different time and place where men were not so easy to read. They still are not easy to read. The only difference is today, we tend to apply our own perceptions and misgivings to people who we truly know nothing about. And in a nutshell this is what this film is all about. Saying more about the film will only give away its secrets. This is a film you want to discover on your own hopefully without having read much about it. It is slow paced, yet very nuanced and beautiful to watch while getting progressively more engaging. I would have liked to have seen more coverage on the young guy but I get the intentions behind its ,at times, vague narrative. The film does explore quite beautifully and visually the way most of us would really like to get a glimpse at the true self of the person to whom we entrust our hearts to. For that alone, I. Believe, the film has achieved its purpose.', 'The second film by Luca Guadagnino to be released in 2024 after Challengers is written by Justin Kuritzkes, who also collaborated on his previous film, and is based on the 1985 novella of the same name by William S. Burroughs. Set in 1950s Mexico City, it follows William Lee (Daniel Craig), an American immigrant, whose solitary life consists of going to bars, self-indulging with younger men, and spending time with a small community of expatriates until he becomes captivated by the mysterious Eugene Allerton (Drew Starkey).\n\nThere is no doubt by now that Luca Guadagnino might be one of the best at portraying desire. Whether it is in gazes or the physicality of bodies in continuous choreography with each other, he understands sensuality like no one else, and his movies always successfully capture a lust for beauty. What he also captures in Queer is the feeling of solace, that sentiment shared by hearts that, even if together, cannot escape its reach, giving place to melancholic memories of times past. And the way Guadagnino portrays it is both beautiful and haunting.\n\nJustin Kuritzkes is not the only Guadagnino collaborator to return in Queer, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are responsible for the score, marking their third collaboration with the Italian director. Since Call Me by Your Name (2017), it is clear that music is very important to Guadagnino to create an atmosphere and transmit the emotional expressivity he aims at. Reznor and Ross made an eclectic score that captures the story\'s nuances from beginning to end. Queer\'s soundtrack also utilizes songs such as Nirvana\'s Come As You Are, enhancing the overall feel of some scenes that perfectly blend image and sound in a way that seems made for each other.\n\nGuadagnino stated this is his most personal film and is a project he wanted to do since he was in his twenties. What Queer offers that makes it stand out in his filmography is the use of dream sequences. Oneiric sequences that further the story\'s complexities, allowing us an open door into its protagonist\'s psyche. Some of those moments bear resemblances to ""Hable con ella"" by Pedro Almodóvar in their use of nudity and miniatures and ""Tár"" by Todd Field in depicting dreams where various characters are present and in their use of hallucinogens.\n\nNarratively, the structure of the film might seem loose at the beginning, although it does not take time for it to take a recognizable shape. There are moments where it deviates from the main story of the characters in order to explore plants and insect-related topics, and in those moments the movie offers an interesting example of how to construct a story while enhancing the limits it can have by adorning it more and more.\n\nThe fact that Daniel Craig portrays a character like William Lee not only furthers his scope as one of the best actors of today but also could be seen as contesting ideas of hypermasculinity embodying the likes of James Bond. It surely is an interesting casting decision, one resembling what Michael Keaton did in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance).', ""I was drawn to this movie as a queer person myself and also due to the fact that it is an A24 film with a star studded cast. However, I think this film tried too hard to be something different and deep.\n\nTo start off, I had no idea what the characters were saying 75% of the time. I needed subtitles so badly, their accents were so difficult to understand. Additionally, the film lacks so much context, and when it does give some, it does so in such a -blink and you'll miss it- type of way.\n\nThings just happen so quickly and inexplicably and I was left confused and unsettled for most of the movie. I feel like you really have to analyze things and apply meaning to the symbolism, and personally that's just not something I like to do TOO extensively when watching a movie. I go the theater to relax and have a good time, not sit there confused and forced to do mental jumping jacks for two hours. Perhaps it is a personal preference or maybe I am too dumb for this movie, but I did not enjoy it in the slightest.\n\nThe characters are not interesting and their development is not satisfying. There's no romance despite it focusing on a relationship for the most part. A good portion of the movie is composed of trippy dream-like sequences which are uncomfortable to watch. Overall I hated this movie and could not wait for it to be over. I paid $16 to watch this and regret it so much. In today's economy, I hate leaving the movie theater disappointed and longing for enjoyable cinema."", ""William Burroughs is one of the most unique and diverse writers in history as his works have created quite a lot of responses and perspectives for the past years. Directed by Luca Guadagnino, it's likely one of his most diverse work in some time as the general responses and reviews have been pretty mixed and polarizing amongst many. However as someone who has read many of Burroughs work, I fond this surrealist and disembodied style of a movie to be fantastic. It creates a weird, psychological and romantic story of self-loathing, depression and regret.\n\nGuadagnino captures the atmosphere, production, camerawork, and sound designs perfectly, illustrating of what Burrough's intentions and style was on the approach of it's narrative. Crafting a painful and investing character study. The way the narrative and dialogue are directed felt nature, strange, psychedelic, yet meditating in many ways to the point it's quite unforgettable.\n\nDaniel Craig, in my opinion, gave one of his best performances in his career. I have never seen Craig with this much range and energy as he had been in his career and it's impressive. Alongside with the other cast performances as well. With great structures and pacing, it never loses it's steam and completely understands the atmosphere, surroundings, character motives, and Burroughs perspective of his vision of romance, queer identity, depression, and hopeless.\n\nLuca Guadagnino continues to stand out as one of the best Italian filmmakers in todays' time and I say, I would be interested to see Guadagnino take another approach to a Burroughs novel."", ""Luca Guadagnino's Queer attempts to translate William S. Burroughs' semi-autobiographical novel into cinema, but it stumbles along the way. The film boasts a visually stunning backdrop and a heartfelt performance by Daniel Craig, yet the disjointed narrative and indulgent pacing hold it back from greatness.\n\nCraig imbues William Lee with vulnerability, but the obsessive fixation on Eugene Allerton, portrayed by Drew Starkey, lacks the depth needed for genuine emotional resonance. The chemistry between the leads is insufficient to spark the tension that the story hinges upon.\n\nGuadagnino's signature aesthetic is unmistakable, with lush cinematography and a thoughtfully curated soundtrack. However, these elements cannot overcome a narrative weighed down by uneven pacing and heavy symbolism. The episodic structure struggles to maintain momentum, making certain scenes feel repetitive and aimless.\n\nFor fans of Guadagnino or experimental storytelling, Queer offers moments of visual and auditory delight, but it falls short of delivering an emotionally profound or memorable cinematic journey.\n\nRating: 7/10 - A visually rich yet emotionally distant adaptation."", ""I approached the release of Queer with high expectations, hoping it would offer a profoundly moving and memorable cinematic experience. The casting of Daniel Craig in the role of a queer man was particularly intriguing. It signaled a departure from his iconic portrayal of the suave James Bond and presented an opportunity to showcase his versatility and depth as an actor. Unfortunately, the film fell far short of these aspirations.\n\nThe primary shortcoming of Queer lies in its lack of a cohesive narrative. Rather than delivering a structured and engaging story, the film feels more like a collection of loosely connected scenes. It focuses on an alcoholic gay writer living in Mexico City, a premise that had the potential to be a profound exploration of isolation, identity, and personal struggle. However, the execution is flawed, and this promising concept never fully materializes. A fragmented and disjointed storyline remains that fails to establish meaningful emotional or thematic connections.\n\nThis incoherent approach undermines the film's potential as a character study. Daniel Craig's performance, while earnest, is constrained by a screenplay that offers him little to work with. His portrayal is overshadowed by the directionless storytelling, leaving what could have been a bold and career-defining role unrealized. It is frustrating to see an actor of Craig's caliber unable to shine due to the limitations of the material.\n\nUltimately, Queer is a missed opportunity. Its fragmented narrative and inability to engage with its themes substantively result in a hollow and unfulfilling viewing experience. While the film flirts with the promise of emotional depth, it never follows through, leaving the audience questioning what they have just seen. Unfortunately, I cannot give this film more than three stars."", ""I'm late to the party with this movie, but I just finished watching Queer (2024) and this movie was a very disappointing experience for me especially coming from Luca Guadagnino and A24.\n\nPositives for Queer (2024): The movie is shot and directed expertly by Luca Guadagnino. The performances from Daniel Craig and Drew Starkey are very good. The themes that are being explored in the movie are done very well. And finally, the movie has a unique style to how the filmmaking is being portrayed here.\n\nNegatives for Queer (2024): The movie is too long and the pacing drags it down a lot. The movie was being a little too weird for me. And finally, there are moments where I wasn't paying attention to what was happening on screen.\n\nOverall, Queer (2024) is a great movie on a technical aspect, but it's one that lost my interest a lot and it was very average."", ""The best way to describe this film is that it's like a dream: visually stunning, things transpire that don't much sense, hazy.\n\nThe best part of the film is the first 45 mins, wherein the two central characters meet and get to know one another. This segment of the film is touching, compelling, sweet, and heartfelt. It showcases a great deal of quiet longing, beautifully punctuated and illustrated by a few scenes of William's inner desires, that are showcased to viewers as silhouettes superimposed over what's happening in reality. The contrast of the two men is also interesting viewing; while William is infatuated and obsessed with Allerton, Allerton is certainly attracted to William, but not really much else.\n\nThe film also has brilliant cinematography, color grading, and is a spectacle. It looks like it was filmed decades ago, adding to the immersion of this taking place in the 1950s. Where this film is mediocre is in its pacing. Much like William, much of the film feels aimless, particularly the second half of the film. And so it drags from time to time. Where the film kind of goes off the rails is when the two travel to South America to a jungle. From that point on, it felt like it jumped the shark and was a totally different film. This section of the film has a number of hallucinatory and surreal scenes that, while visually great, don't really add much to the love story between the two characters. The ending also felt tacked on and didn't really integrate well with the rest of the film. The ending, and I'm being vague here to avoid spoilers, is supposed to pay homage to William Burroughs, the author of the book the film is based on, by reenacting a real-life tragedy, but it felt arbitrary and sort of silly.\n\nDaniel Craig and Drew Starkey both give excellent performances. Where Craig is emotive and showy, Starkey is aloof and subtle. And this contrast really works here. Lesley Manville is also good, in a very different role for her. The performances, cinematography, and unique storytelling really elevate this film. While it was boring at times and the director makes some queer choices, it can't be denied that this film still has its merits."", ""The casual cinemagoer will not be a happy camper after viewing Queer. However, you will find this worth a look if you are interested in one or more of the following: 1) Wm. S. Burroughs' life and writings; 2) The Beat generation in general; 3) The sociology of gay culture, especially the challenges faced by sexually active older gay men; 4) Artistic representations of addiction and psychedelic experience; 5) Art direction and production values in arthouse cinema; 6) Daniel Craig breaking the shackles of his Bond legacy in spectacular fashion; 7) The director of Call Me by Your Name tackling another, but highly different, gay relationship.\n\nSo, a lot of possibilities that you may be enticed. If you are a Burroughs afficianado, you will find the film largely faithful to the book. Craig captures the desperation of the Burroughs surrogate, Bill Lee, as he seeks physical connection with an assortment of largely disinterested young men in Mexico City of the 1950's.\n\nDrew Starkey is Eugene Allerton, the enigmatic drifter upon whom Lee fixates. Is Allerton straight? Gay? Bi? An open minded sexual adventurer or perhaps even a calculating and skillful hustler? His shifting responses to Lee's advances are open to differing interpretations and provide much of the fascination of the narrative.\n\nBased on Burroughs' actual experiences, we follow this ill-matched pair through their hot, then cold, then transactional couplings, leading to a surreal search through a South American jungle in pursuit of a legendary psychedelic plant.\n\nThe production is beautifully designed and a feast for the eyes, with realism eschewed for a hyper falsity that heightens the aura of a world as experienced by a dysfunctional addict and sexual adventurer. Craig looks suitably debased and obsessive, while his somewhat nerdy paramour vaguely resembles a young bespectacled Burroughs.\n\nAs events become increasingly surreal, some cinemagoers will be reminded of the enigmatic denouement of Kubrick's 2001, A Space Odyssey, but with the clean-cut astronauts replaced by the morally compromised habitues of Mexico City's demimonde. Whether this intrigues or frustrates the viewer will depend on one's personal cinematic expectations.\n\nThere will be many, who having seen this latest effort from director Luca Guadagnino, will wish they hadn't bothered. Others, like me, will look forward to a second or even third viewing of this challenging work."", ""A genuinely beautiful film that, two days on, is still firmly on my mind. I haven't read the book, but now I know that I soon shall. The acting is excellent; the cinematography and the visuals are great; the direction is exquisite; and the plot and script are more than sound. I was completely enchanted, and enthralled, throughout. I didn't once wonder what the time was, or attempt to check my watch. On the contrary, I didn't want this film to end. It isn't a happy film, no, and it may not be entirely perfect, either (I'm rating it 9 rather than 10), but it really is a very good film that I can truthfully and heartily recommend. You may cry, but you, like me, will probably find it very moving and worthwhile, too. I agree with the Telegraph of London - they rated it 5/5. Rightly so, I say."", 'The film ""Queer"" is a slow exploration that crafts its narrative in four distinct parts. Its unconventional storytelling weaves a deliberate pace that immerses the audience in an atmospheric experience rather than relying on a traditional plot structure. Viewers are invited to grasp subtle nuances and thematic undercurrents throughout.\n\nThe story\'s progression is enigmatic, I wish telepathy had hinted at the lack of an ultimate conclusion early on, it needs to be able to maintain interest as the film delves deeper into realms of abstraction and introspection. Each segment of ""Queer"" is nicely crafted in a unique stylistic approach, rich in visual and auditory elements, which prompts viewers to interpret meaning from symbolism and imagery.\n\nThe film\'s meditative pace may not cater to all tastes, yet it rewards those who are patient with a resonant and reflective narrative journey. Ultimately, ""Queer"" stands as a tribute to the art of storytelling through innovation.', ""Even as it gets really surreal towards the end, Queer remains a deeply empathetic work centring on a relationship where one person's affection massively outweighs the other. It definitely feels it's run time thanks to long chapters but always remains investing across all four chapters. It's on a very specific wavelength from the start that you'll either get with or completely bounce off.\n\nDaniel Craig is excellent as a lovelorn romantic. He's extroverted yet so lonely which makes his desire to find a partner in Drew Starkey all the more tragic when he keeps going despite Starkey's indifference. Starkey himself is an enigma as he's a man of few words with just enough hints to keep Craig going. In the supporting cast Jason Schwartzman is a lot of fun and Lesley Manville is completely unrecognisable.\n\nLuca Guadagnino's direction captures yearning so beautifully in dirty, sweaty fashion, enhanced by the colourful locations and Jonathan Anderson's stylishly era appropriate costumes. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is a nice mix of their usual work and some new elements and the soundtrack is an unexpected highlight with a collection of songs that go way beyond the time period it's set in and still work so well."", 'This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular gay love and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way.\n\nDirector Luca Guadagnino is one of the greatest queer directors of the 21 century. I hope he wins many Oscars for this Master piece in 2025. I would recommend this movie to anyone.\n\nI can ashure you that after you have watched it once you will want to watch it again straight away due to how great it is.', 'From a critic\'s point of view and also from a personal POV, this is jaw-droppingly incredible! Lighting, set, acting, camera, everything was spot-on. The sex was surprising and intense, especially for an inter-generational male twosome. The psychedelic scenes were beyond ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and the soundtrack was killer.\n\nCraig\'s older character, Lee, is inspirational, tragically yearning, desperate and sometimes manic. Starkey\'s young character, Eugene, is reserved, difficult to fathom, cold and independent. The contrast creates suspense that pulls the heart and mind. Together, they create a dynamic that you never know where it\'s going, especially in the drugged-out scenes that seem to keep coming, along with the erotic and trippy content.\n\nEnjoy this powerful movie on as large a screen as possible.', ""The movie was promising. Great director with a history to tell. A good cast. I could give it a higher rating for the Cinematography, takes and pictures.

But there's not a single thing about this movie I can enjoy. The script is as bland as an American penne vodka dish.\n\nIt is unfortunate the waste of talent. Of course, as many other films with LGBT theme, the homoerotism gives some 'excitement' to this movie. But even wittdrawal scenes are unreal...\n\nI'm writing this review while 'watching' the movie. I could walk out of boredom but I refuse to do that."", ""I appreciate the unapologetic and genuine execution. And what an execution indeed. My head fell straight off. I was entranced by this remarkably odd motion picture. I was charmed by the rugged and subtle message about existence. Embodying nothing but the pure essence of a queer life. To experience itself the experiencer experiences the experience in the experience to experience to eternal experience. Resting. Preparing to fly again. Whatever that means.\n\nAHHHHH. Just got back from the theaters but I really need to squeeze my cat. He won't squeeze me back. But he might lay on my legs. Thats nice."", ""For anyone who thought Craig's best performances of James Bond, and maybe type cast him as a gun toting playboy action hero, you need to see Queer. Craig's performance was in deep contrast to everything else he has ever done. It redefines him as a versatile actor whose broad range rivals all the phenomenal actors who have come before him. His ability to play Lee in such a convincing way while not shying away from erotic gay sexual scenes that would make OnlyFan's blush. The entire cast has stepped up their game to keep up with Craig's masterful performance. Starkey's performance of. Allerton'a back and forth with Lee demonstrates how both actors compliment each other on the screen."", ""I know it's one of the most generic ways to describe why you didn't like a movie but all I can say about Queer is that I just found it boring. There's still a lot I need to see a lot of Luca Guadagnino's work but everything I like about the films of his I have seen just don't see present at all in Queer.\n\nSimilar to Call Me By Your Name it's very light on story and more about characters and their interactions but unlike that film I didn't get much out of the scenes between Daniel Craig and Drew Starkey. Craig is one of my favourite actors and I love seeing him in roles like this but I didn't think the chemistry between these two characters was anything that special. The scenes they share feel insanely repetitive with dialogue that doesn't really give the sense that we're getting to know much about them so not much ever seemed to be going on under the surface. The final 3rd of the film did pick up a bit for me thanks to a wonderfully unhinged performance by Lesley Manville but the film had already lost my interest long before then.\n\nFrom a visual perspective I also found this movie to be pretty dull which is something I find utterly astounding given the visual feats Guadagnino has pulled off in the past. There's the occasional interesting visual but the directing so often feels like it's just going through the beats and getting the necessary coverage without much real intent. With how repetitive these scenes feel the use of more interesting visuals could've helped distinguish them better. There's also not much of an atmosphere to speak of so I never really felt much of anything as the film plodded along. The whole thing ends up feeling like an assembly cut rather with the amount of scenes and sequences that end up feeling far too elongated. All I can say is that I feel a bit relived that the supposed 3-hour plus cut of this movie never saw the light of day.\n\nI think Queer is a movie that will speak to a lot of people who will get a lot more out of it than I did but for me nothing I've liked about Luca Guadagnino's work carried over to this movie. I have no problems with films that are light on plot but the characters and the tone did nothing for me on top of that. I can see the potential that this text has but the execution just didn't do it justice in my eyes. A film that will be sure to divide people but I can't see myself ever having an interesting conversation about it."", 'Channeling Burroughs with sublime skill, sans the nasal projection of the master writer, it is a pleasure to see Daniel Craig pay homage. I was wondering from the start if Craig would go full-Burroughs, and to his credit he only casts a brilliant shadow. Throughout, however, he possesses the fluid movements and elegance that Burroughs maintained. Craig\'s ""curtsey"" bow at the first sight of Atherton in itself is worthy of an Oscar nod. That bow is the introduction to the world of not-so-hidden homosexuality in outer Mexico. Demonstrating the teenage angst of any would-be suitor, Craig takes us on the journey of hopeful discovery with the new-found Adonis of Atherton.\n\nQueer is a subtle grab at the 1950\'s age, every thread bare jacket, every pair of glasses, every Fedora, every cigarette, every piece of furniture, every weather-worn street sign is a testament to a painstakingly accurate period piece. Even with the somewhat jarring placement of modern music, (A nod to Curt Cobain\'s friendship with Burroughs, I have read) director Guadagnino never fails to submerge the viewer in an almost fairytale environment of the backwaters of old Mexico or South America. Technically the film is a marvel. It trained eye will notice that, much like a film by Wes Anderson, the film makers are demonstrating absolute skill in creating a world that was and is surely not now in existence. Once ensconced, the viewer is in for a great ride. Following Burroughs novel to a point, the film is almost documentary in exploring new, tenuous, homosexual relations stuck in the amber of the 1950\'s. As Lee, Craig deftly dances around the hope of a real, lasting relationship with his new lover like a school kid at the prom. Then, when he decides to pursue the ultimate trip with him with the aid of Ayahuasca, the film eviscerates both characters souls and allows the viewer to explore the possibilities that Lee so desperately seeks.\n\nGuadagnino is unfailing in his display of true homosexuality with no hidden Hollywood glitz. This is the real thing. Several times Guadagnino plays with the hidden desires of anyone on a date with hopeful measure by double exposing what is really happening with a faded exposure of that longing touch that never comes in the theater or in the car. It is a relief to actually see two men perform all the given acts, scenes, angles and fade-aways that make up any given coitus scene of merit in film history. Most touching and revealing is the post-coitus looks, small-talk, long-talk, cigarettes, munchies and arguments that seem to permeate the real world. Warts and all, Burroughs would no doubt have been very proud.', 'Daniel\'s performance was impeccable and showed the Lee that Burroughs had in mind, but Drew\'s performance was baffling - expressionlessness is not a ""perfect imperfect listener"" performance in my mind.\n\nBurroughs said that Eugene was actually the audience Lee wanted, and the less Eugene responded (not equal to poker face) to Lee\'s performance, the more Lee found a mask to hide his broken state.\n\nFurthermore, I wonder about the audience\'s criticisms of Parts 3 and 4 - aren\'t drugs and stream-of-consciousness the real Burroughs, and isn\'t it true that Eugene, under the influence of the Ayahuasca, finally admits to being a Queer, but then disappears, and is there really an Eugene? Is Eugene really Eugene? Is Eugene just an illusion that has always existed in Lee\'s mind? Without drugs and without an audience, Lee loses the meaning of his existence.', ""A slow-moving story of a heroin addict (Craig) who prowls around seedy areas of Mexico City. He finds a degree of companionship (albeit an uneasy one) with a much younger lad. They drink, they smoke, they have sex and they occasionally spar off at each other. Aside from Craig's junkie existence as a struggling writer, there isn't much depth or character development. The last 3rd of the film is a strange foray into the Ecuador rainforest--with some unsettling and surreal moments. The cinematography and special effects are top-notch, but these elements are not enough the carry the film. Infusing Nine Inch Nails music to the 1950's setting is a misfire."", ""Rating - 5.4: Overall, a pretty boring movie that cannot be saved by its surrealist design and Daniel Craig's performance; the writing and pacing really drag down this movie.\n\nDirection - Decent: The direction on a macroscale is good as it creates the surrealist world that matches the writing of William S.

Or to put it accurately, taken out by toxic feminists! This was just a horrific choice by the once man\'s man of actors. It\'s disturbing to see so many people adopt such extreme views and changes. So into the trash goes my fond memories of this actor. Which I\'m sure is EXACTLY what these activist/writers want! For everything that made heroes great to be forgotten.\n\nAs for this film, meh.... Guess I\'ve just had my fill of the pride themes. Whole community has overplayed their role in the world. Now it\'s become cliche and boring. So good job! You\'ve turned and discouraged real supporters away, in exchange for internet muppets who use the rainbow to gather clout.\n\nSave your time and money. There are far better things to waste them on.', ""I went to see this film on Tuesday 17th 2024 at Cine Lumiere with my Mum. The film started off well but after Part 2 gradually went downhill. This is an autobiographical film based on a book by William S Burroughs . It starts with Daniel Craig's character getting obsessed with a young man and proceeds to follow him around Mexico and go to see a quack played by Lesley Manville and there the film gets really weird and a sequence of them getting high on opium follows. The young man does not reciprocate Daniel Craig's feelings at all. You might like to know that Daniel Craig is up for an Oscar for his role. This is directed by the same director that directed Call Me By Your Name and it is no where near as good. Be prepared to feel queer."", 'There are good adaptations of Burroughs (Cronenberg\'s Naked Lunch). And then there\'s this. Almost nothing works. Especially Daniel Craig\'s labored, fussy, pained caricature. His torturously-performed monologue about queerness stops the movie dead. It never recovers. Director Luca Guadagnino has previously made great movies (Bones and All). This isn\'t one of them. He peppers the soundtrack with anachronistic Nirvana songs. Aside from a wordless sequence where Craig falls for a bland pretty boy at a street cock fight set to ""Come As You Are"", the Cobain scoring just doesn\'t work. There\'s no plot, just scenes. Nothing builds. How could you make this material boring? They found a way.', ""I fear my stars are not aligned with Luca Guadagnino. Twice now, he has taken tales I hold dear, stories I have cherished for years, and drained them of their very essence.\n\nLike many of my generation, I consider the works of William S. Burroughs to be sacred texts. Luca Guadagnino, much as he did with André Aciman's Call Me by Your Name, has taken this book, hollowed it out, and turned it into mere Oscar bait.\n\nI suspect we shall never see another Burroughs adaptation that retains the spirit of the original, save for Naked Lunch (1991).\n\nThe film is so uneven that it betrays signs of troubled production. For instance, Daniel Craig attempts an accent but seems to forget it from time to time.\n\nAs a makeup artist myself, I cannot help but view such works through that lens, and credit must be given where it is due... The makeup team hath likely created work that shall at least garner them an Academy nomination.\n\nIf I were to offer a brief assessment of the film, I would say: A most ostentatious emptiness."", ""I understand Craig is being highlighted for his acting by getting away from the traditional Bond roles. Here he plays an aging gay man in Mexico, for the most part, who picks up young men.\n\nI have no problem with his sexual role; but it seems uncertain exactly where to place his American accent.\n\nThe film - Luca Guadalagno as director- meanders between tequila shots and cigarettes and heroin and ayahuasca.\n\nMany of the so called cinematic effects are pretentious - something like a Dali dreamscape, and we're not actually sure that the city behind the hotel windows is not fake.\n\nStarlet is a cold fish that adds nothing to the film.\n\nI did enjoy the woman in the jungle. She and I are having a pretty good laugh.\n\nI wish this film had better represented what Boroughs was writing about."", ""The only stars it deserves are for Daniel Craig, who portrays a character completely different from himself and does so wonderfully. Beyond that, the film comes across as pretentious. What initially starts as a story of love, misunderstandings, entanglements, and disinterest shifts into an intense romantic drama that feels out of place due to the lack of chemistry between the two leads. The ending feels disconnected, as there's no real passion between the characters; if this was intentional, it simply doesn't make sense. The film also overstays its welcome by at least half an hour. The use of the color palette was interesting and well-executed, and Trent Reznor's music was brilliant as always. A disappointing film, considering its otherwise well-chosen cast."", 'I guess I didn\'t have a well-rounded understanding of the source material, or perhaps I just didn\'t ""get it"", but this one felt like it was trying way too hard to be something more than it really was.\n\nIt felt like we were all just there to see Daniel Craig play daddy with a young supermodel- yet, we must pretend that there is more substance to this movie than there actually is.\n\nThey\'re not in love- it\'s not really about love. It\'s not really about being queer in the 50\'s. It\'s not really about addiction. It\'s not really about exploring your world through psychedelics. It\'s not really about telepathy.\n\nIt\'s mainly about sex- and I\'m fine with that- but why do we need to prop up 3 or 4 older/younger sex scenes with 2 additional hours of film that never really builds a cohesive or engaging story?\n\nThis film shines in it\'s backgrounds, trippy visuals, unusual soundtrack choices, and sex scenes (plus a stellar performance from Leslie Manville that kept me awake during the last 45 minutes).']",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/queer/8eea5ff1-961a-46a5-aac8-dc02dad0c01b.webp

I also regularly find entertainment from stupid, lower quality movies. And I've enjoyed many of the other Sony-Marvel side universe movies.\n\nThere are also some cool actions scenes. I'm ecstatic they went for an R rating instead of being cowards (looking at you, Morbius). But by far the best part of this movie is Aaron Taylor-Johnson. His acting talent is on full display and he elevates every scene he's in.\n\nOkay now the bad. This movie is all over the place, unfocused and pretty dumb. There are multiple moments of unintentional humor, including one of the funniest character reactions I've ever seen. The dialogue and line delivery is bad. The CGI is bad. It's a generally poorly-made movie.\n\nBut by far the worst part is the performance by Ariana DeBose. I really don't like being mean, but this is third thing I've seen her in (Argylle and I. S. S.), and she does NOT belong. I couldn't stop noticing how unconvincing she was. Her line delivery made me laugh. In scenes with her and Taylor-Johnson, the contrast in talent could not be more stark.\n\nLook, you already know if this is something you would enjoy. If it looks stupid to you, don't watch it.

Great cast held back by clunky dull dialogue. The script is simply bad and a waste of Aaron Taylor Johnson, who I actually enjoyed in the role. Another instance of a villain turned hero.

The film doesn\'t understand a single character it tries to adapt to screen and the whole movie often feels created by AI.\n\nIt is better than ""Madame Web"" and ""Venom: The Last Dance"" which isn\'t saying much, but if this is the end of the Sony Spider-Man-less universe, at least I\'m glad it\'s over.', 'The latest entry in the Spider-Man adjacent movies, Kraven delivers on super-hero based action, broad predictable characters and a by-the-numbers plot.\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson delivers a solid performance, with an impressive amount of physicality.

Russel Crowe seemed very nonchalant about his role so much that he came to collect a paycheck like Jared Harris did for Morbius.\n\nAriana Debose as the intriguing and mysterious witch doctor Calypso has nothing substantial to add in the plot, Fred Hechinger's Dmitri better known as the master of disguise Chameleon is equally worthless.\n\nMost disappointing has to be Alessandro Nivola's Rhino who transforms into a human rhino hybrid voluntarily instead of being a victim of inhumane government experiment gone awry as in the source material.\n\nRhino who is usually depicted as a mindless brute is a much sympathetic character when you learn he has been wronged by corrupt bureaucrats and wants to cease his existence by separating from the surgically grafted exoskeleton.\n\nBut ofcourse none of layered backstory is adapted her instead of being made into some kind of mutated abomination both literally and figuratively.\n\nThe only highlights of this mediocre half hearted attempt is the brutal and blood filled action scenes sprinkled throughout. But that alone can't save a movie from being a complete failure.\n\nI for one am elated that Sony's decision makers have finally accepted defeat as their spin off films have ceased to be produced as of now as per The Wrap's authentic sources claim.\n\nAfter destroying the Venom franchise by handing over the directorial duties to the nepotistic snake like Kelly Marcel (a close confidante and off screen quasi concubine of lead actor Tom Hardy), Sony has witnessed the fall of their cash cow with the Last dance earning less than half of the first Venom film.\n\nAlienating audiences has never been easy in the history of movies and killing off waning interest in the future entries.\n\nSave your money and catch it on streaming if you are desperate for this utter nonsense."", ""I decided to ignore the bad ratings of the movie because I have loved Aaron Taylor's Johnson acting ability in every movie I've seen him in.

A tough character to adapt to film. In the comic it's easy to make him massive and powerful by just wearing a suit. The version from Amazing Spider Man 2 was horrible.

I could not have been more wrong. Now, credit where credit is due, the score was great and Taylor-Johnson did the best with what he was given. The quality was brought down by the sketchy CGI (Some looked fine, others terrible) and the atrocious acting from the supporting actors! Granted, the script did no one any favours, but it seemed like a few actors did not even try to make it work. This made it very difficult to stay in the fictional world because the dialogue and the characters felt so disconnected. The main female lead also felt a bit shoe horned in to get the feminism points and it took away character development from some of the other characters.

The film is a completely meaningless spectacle that negates all expectations.\n\nThe plot is flat and predictable: you can guess how it will end at the beginning.

The dialogues are written as if they were written by a person without the slightest idea of how a conversation sounds in real life.\n\nVisual effects? It\'s hard to believe that this is really a modern movie. In places they look like unfinished drawings, and trying to enjoy them is like watching an old videotape.\n\nAs for acting, it ranged from frankly weak to comical.

I didn't know anything about the character or story beforehand, so it was all new to me. I was surprised that Kraven wasn't the only enhanced human (Rhino, Foreigner), but it just made it a bit more interesting.\n\nI am bothered by how many people denigrated Ariana Debose, who was fine with what she was given. Fred Hechinger (who was also on Gladiator II) was decent as the brother.\n\nWas it perfect? Heck no. But it was much better than I expected! It is a fun movie to see, better than many out there. Oh, and shockingly no extra scene during or after the credits!"", ""Personally, I expected a lot from this movie, since it was R-rated, more blood and more creative action scenes, but the movie could not create this, despite the character, Hunter Kraken is a really charismatic and solid character, it was even the style of this character that carried the action scenes, but a suitable script could not be found. He couldn't do it in a way that could be based on the villain character, the designs in the locations were very strange and he combined it with CGI. I have a style that loves CGI. Also, the movie was not entertaining at all, it could not create that entertainment at all. I personally saw a movie that did not happen, but they had the potential to do it. I liked the entertaining structure of Deadpool & Wolverine, they had filled it with blood, but this was missing in this movie."", ""Kraven the Hunter is one of the stronger Marvel films to date. Its dark, gritty tone and the compelling performances of two standout characters-Kraven and his father (played by Russell Crowe, who gives one of his best performances in recent years)-really make the film work for me.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths is its personal, grounded storyline. Rather than focusing on world-ending stakes, the plot centers around family drama, which makes it feel more intimate and engaging.\n\nWhile some of the CGI could have been improved, this seems to be a common issue across recent MCU and SMU films (with a few exceptions, like Deadpool and Logan). That said, it doesn't detract significantly from the overall experience.\n\nIn short, I thoroughly enjoyed Kraven the Hunter. It's dark, gritty, and bloody-everything you'd want from this type of film. I'd love to see Aaron Taylor-Johnson return to the role, but we all know how these things go.\n\nSo, head to your local cinema, grab a ticket, and I promise you'll get your money's worth.

I loved the part when Kraven looked directly into the camera and said ""I\'m gonna Krave all over you.""\n\nThis movie will sweep the award season. Films like this should be placed inside a time capsule so future civilizations can sit and watch with awe at the glorious works of art that this generation produced. But by then Kraven will already be a well established household name. In fact, all future currency will become Kraven Bucks in honor of this amazing box office achievement. All hail Lord Kraven!!', ""Kraven the Hunter: A Formulaic Struggle for Independence in the Marvel Universe\n\nThe film Kraven the Hunter, directed by J. C. Chandor, aimed to present a darker, more introspective origin story within the Marvel Universe.\n\nPositioned as an antihero film, it sought to stand apart from the standard superhero formula. However, its execution left audiences underwhelmed due to a lack of character depth, poorly developed relationships, and a misstep in storytelling focus.\n\nThe Storyline and Antihero Setup\n\nThe narrative centers on Sergei Kravinoff, aka Kraven (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who gains supernatural abilities allowing him to communicate with animals after a violent encounter with a lion his father was hunting. While the premise of Kraven as a hunter who turns into a protector of nature had potential, the film struggled to develop this transition in a meaningful way. The incorporation of animal-based powers felt rushed and poorly explained, leaving the audience disconnected from Kraven's true meaning.\n\nKraven's motivations, particularly his protective instincts toward his brother, Dimitri (Fred Hechinger), are intended to ground him as a sympathetic antihero. Yet, the film glosses over this bond, except for the fact that he visited his brother on his birthday every year, failing to explore the complexities of their relationship. This lack of emotional grounding made it difficult for viewers to connect with Kraven on a personal level.\n\nUnderdeveloped Relationships\n\nThe relationship between Kraven and Calypso (Ariana DeBose), a mystic figure with ties to Kraven's animal abilities, is another missed opportunity. Their dynamic could have offered insight into Kraven's newfound powers and deepened the mystical elements of the story. But it does not explain much past the grandmother's connection to tarot cards which predict a tragedy then an uprising of strength. Instead, their connection feels superficial and underexplored, reducing Calypso's role to a narrative afterthought rather than a significant influence on Kraven's transformation or even partnership.\n\nAttempting to Break the Mold\n\nMarvel has been struggling to recapture its earlier success, and Kraven the Hunter highlights these challenges. The film tries to diverge from the typical Marvel formula, presenting a more cinematic and independent vision. Yet, in doing so, it loses sight of what made Marvel movies resonate with audiences-compelling characters, engaging storytelling, and impactful relationships.\n\nThe inclusion of Russell Crowe as Sergei's father was clearly intended to lend gravitas to the film, but even his presence couldn't elevate the material. The father-son conflict, which should have served as a compelling backbone for Kraven's character development, feels formulaic and lacks emotional weight.\n\nMissed Opportunities for World-Building\n\nOne of the film's most glaring issues is its failure to fully embrace and develop the mysticism behind Kraven's abilities. Marvel has successfully integrated mystic elements in films like Doctor Strange, where the backstory and rules of the supernatural are meticulously crafted. In contrast, Kraven the Hunter barely scratches the surface of its protagonist's powers, leaving viewers confused rather than captivated.\n\nThe connection between Kraven and the animals, a central theme of the character, is treated as an afterthought rather than a pivotal element. This weakens the audience's ability to buy into Kraven's role as a protector of nature, making his motivations feel hollow.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nUltimately, Kraven the Hunter fails to justify its existence within the Marvel Universe. The story feels like an unnecessary addition, struggling to establish its identity as a darker, standalone tale. While it attempts to break free from the Marvel formula, it stumbles in creating a compelling, cohesive narrative.\n\nThe film's underdeveloped characters and relationships, coupled with a lack of focus on its mystical elements, leave it feeling incomplete. Marvel's attempts to attract audiences with star power and a grittier tone fall flat, highlighting the studio's current struggle to innovate while maintaining the emotional resonance that defined its earlier successes.\n\nKraven the Hunter might have been a chance to tell a unique, character-driven story, but it instead stands as a reminder that even antihero films require depth, world-building, and emotional stakes to succeed."", 'Kraven the Hunter is a huge mess of mismatched tones and half-baked. Breakneck pacing, eye searing editing, ADR so excessive it felt like half the lines were recorded in a broom closet the day before release. Absolute madness.\n\nLet\'s start with Kraven himself. Aaron Taylor-Johnson gives us a supervillain who can growl one second, crack a random Marvel-style joke the next, and then swing back to brooding like someone took his protein shake. The sass feels so out of place you almost expect him to wink at the camera like Deadpool. He doesn\'t, but it\'s close.\n\nThe backstory at the beginning? Boilerplate to the point of parody. Ruthless dad, tragic childhood, a dash of ""nature is calling"" melodrama, and voila! Instant anti-hero. But after that, the movie barely gives anyone a reason to do anything. Why are these characters even here? Who knows! Motivations are so flimsy, they make Kraven\'s paper-thin leopard-print costume look sturdy.\n\nAnd speaking of characters, they\'re all generic archetypes straight out of a ""How to Write Villains 101"" handbook. You\'ve got your evil big-game hunters, your generic voodoo priestess, and Rhino-oh, poor Rhino. Alessandro Nivola gives it his all, but even he can\'t make ""Like a RHINO!!"" sound like anything other than a Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nThe action sequences are frantic and soulless, drowning in fake CGI and lacking any weight or charm. By the time CG buffalo are stampeding across the screen, you\'ve already accepted that nothing in this movie makes sense, and everything is chaos.\n\nIt\'s not all bad-actually... I was laughing throughout most of the 2 hour movie, as was the rest of the theater. Kraven the Hunter tried to be edgy and wild, but it endsd up feeling like a mess of mismatched tones and half-baked ideas. If you\'re into unintentionally hilarious madness, this might be your jam. Otherwise, this one\'s for the Madame Web fans-if they exist.', ""7.5/10 In my opinion, Kraven the Hunter delivers an entertainingly violent final mission in what potentially marking Sony's last attempt at a Spider-Man villain spin-off, and when you compare the spin off films apart from the Venom trilogy, i think Kraven The Hunter has already surpassed the awful Madame Web just by the violent itself even if the main story didn't engage most of the audience except me who found it engaging enough to enjoy, added with good addition to the film with both Russell Crowe and one of the Emperor twins in Gladiator II, Fred Hechinger, the violent was fun, and Kraven himself stands out as a compelling antihero, the film is far from a groundbreaking cinematic achievement and its flaws are evident, the overall thrilling hunt is pure entertainment, it serves as a passable, and in my opinion a pretty good conclusion to Sony's strange and seemingly confused Spider-Man universe, of all the characters introduced, Tom Hardy's Venom and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Kraven are the two i'd most like to see return, perhaps in a future MCU."", ""....but failed in its delivery about 20 minutes after the start.

The plot doesn't make a ton of sense once you start breaking it down, but the actions scenes are fast paced and unique. It definitely benefits from the R rating, letting us see Kraven's use of mostly edged weapons in detail. Overall an enjoyable movie that over-performed my somewhat low expectations. I think it's a better watch than the last two venom movies, morbius, and definitely madame web."", ""I don't understand how they can still be doing those bad Marvels when they've been in this for so long.

As a critic."", 'Despite the negative reviews, I found ""Kraven the Hunter"" to be a compelling and entertaining film. The movie\'s darker tone adds depth to the narrative, and its action sequences are reminiscent of the intense, high-stakes confrontations like seen in a movies like the Jason Bourne series. The antagonists are portrayed as formidable adversaries, providing a genuine challenge to the protagonist and enhancing the film\'s suspense.\n\nWhile some critics have highlighted flaws like a ""clunky, crowded script"" and ""muddy visual effects,"" I found the film\'s strengths to far outweigh its shortcomings. Its engaging storyline, unexpected twists, thrilling action, and dynamic character interactions-featuring formidable villains-make it an entertaining watch. The movie also stands out for its portrayal of superhero powers, showcasing them in a way that feels fresh, dynamic, and truly captivating. However I will say, the character who gave Kraven the potion felt unnecessary, and the dialogue between them lacked substance, detracting slightly from the overall experience. That said, Kraven\'s portrayal as a layered, complex anti-hero brings a fresh and compelling perspective to the superhero genre.\n\nBottom line the movie is entertaining, isn\'t that what we want? Some bad dialogue but really ""Kraven the Hunter"" offers a thrilling cinematic experience a little darker narrative than Marvel movies done by Disney but has fun intense action sequences. It successfully delivers an engaging story that keeps the audience invested from start to finish.', 'ATJ Was really the perfect person for this role but suffered due to the script.

Understanding that this is a comic-book movie, that still doesn\'t meet any standards that have been set over the past several decades. The action scenes were very good, Crowe comes across as a perfect narcissist of a criminal overlord thug. I liked the idea of the Rhino\'s character but he just seemed to be missing something to make his role better in this film. With such a horrible opening weekend, I\'m guessing the subtitle of this move will be ""straight to video"" from here on out. Overall disappointed because I was hoping for so much more out of one of the coolest characters in the old Spider-Man comics I grew up reading.', ""Gotta be one of the best R rated movie with Marvel characters!

C. Chandor and stars such as Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Russell Crowe would ensure at least a modest amount of entertainment value was there for the taking in this two hour outing.\n\nThese hopes for things being OK are quickly dashed around 10 minutes into proceedings.\n\nA generic by the numbers origin story/tiresome anti-hero goes up against a barely established ""big bad"" plot line makes Kraven\'s task to be entertaining or surprising a monumental one with hopes laying purely on the shoulders of Chandor somehow managing to instil the same magic he found in breakout debut Margin Call or his crime classic A Most Violent Year, Taylor-Johnson finally getting to breakout in another lead role after a few lean years or Kraven\'s uncompromisingly bloodthirsty action raising the pulse levels but none of these facets come to fruition in this sad and sorry excuse for a feature film.\n\nDrab, unloved, cold and cumbersome, Kraven is all of the unfortunate things that have infiltrated the Sony/Marvel collaborations over recent time with Chandor\'s film feeling like it shares much in common with misfires that were Morbius and Madame Web.\n\nFrom terrible PS2 like CGI segments, a wooden script that would make an amateurish screen-writing workshop participant blush and a sense of second hand embarrassment watching talented actors lower their colours in such an affair, from Crowe\'s comical accent, Fred Hechinger\'s Tony Bennett impressions or Alessandro Nivola\'s snarling like an animal, Kraven is filled with laughable acting moments, Kraven is misfiring on all cylinders and reeks of a film that was abandoned in the care department long before it reached its eventual release date.\n\nYou have to give Sony credit in some ways, to monumentally get it wrong so consistently in the Marvel space is some sought of feat.\n\nTo think they have managed to wrong so many well-liked characters and worlds across recent memory is hard to come to terms with, it makes one wonder how it was all allowed to go so bad with Kraven somewhat enjoyable as a train wreck watch similar to its kin Morbius and Madame Web but at the same time a film hard to watch as you witness talented artists lower their colours on a money laundering scheme of the lowest order.\n\nFinal Say -\n\nWorking best as a film to enjoy as an unexpected comedy full of quotable one-liners, terrible storytelling and embarrassed actors, Kraven the Hunter couldn\'t fight the good fight to become more than was hoped it could be, becoming exactly the dumpster fire many (including its studio) expected it to be.\n\n1 hardy tarot card out of 5.\n\nJordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)', 'Most movies fail to deliver after reshoots and delays but ""Kraven the Hunter"" is an exception.

At the same time, it feels like there's too little substance overall, with the story meandering aimlessly for most of its runtime.\n\nThe pacing is another major issue-at over two hours, the movie feels far too long for what it's trying to achieve. By the halfway point, it becomes clear that the direction is vague and lacks a clear vision. It feels like the filmmakers were unsure whether they wanted to create a character-driven story or a mindless action flick, and the result is a frustrating middle ground that fails to do justice to either.\n\nWhile there are a few decent action sequences sprinkled throughout, they aren't enough to save the film. The script is poorly written, filled with generic dialogue and half-baked character arcs.

You may be surprised to hear that there are some good crumbs here. The best thing about this movie is the cinematography, which is mostly average. There is some noticeably good camera work at a warmly lit bar, as well as a room with silhouettes in front of few large fans. The rest is just okay, nothing spectacular. As far as characters go, Aaron Taylor Johnson executes a single cool moment where he says ""found you"" before a brutal kill with a crossbow. Despite Russel Crowe\'s appearance, that one Kraven scene is the only noteworthy bit. Regarding action, while shoddy, there thankfully isn\'t as much shaky-cam as you\'d see in a Taken film. Finally, the pacing isn\'t terrible.\n\nOkay, the positives are out of the way. What makes this picture a misfire? The character arcs are undercooked, as in, they haven\'t even been put in the oven yet. Kraven is, appropriately, the most developed one of the lot. Even so, he is by no means a well-written character. He hunts, he likes animals, he cares for his brother, and he hates his dad. That\'s as complicated as it gets. The others were so dull that I cannot remember their names, meaning I care as much about them as the writers did. The female lawyer exists and leaves the film out of nowhere. The brother also is in the movie, and his arc is as smooth as mountain terrain. There\'s an airplane pilot somewhere in the movie, as well as an elderly lady who may be a card goddess of some kind. Again, I care as much as the film does.\n\nThis film could have been a goofy watch if they leaned heavier on its absurdly silly and/or bad elements. For example, the CGI looks like it was rendered back in 2004. Of course, that wouldn\'t be problematic if it weren\'t for the fact that it cost well over $100 million to produce. If they made this bad GCI zanier, they could have made the unintentionally funny film be, well, intentionally comedic. Think of ""Kung Pow! Enter the Fist\'s"" cow fight scene as an example. Also, talk about a wasted R-rating. I am not one to care what picture gets rated what; but I do believe that a rating should be the result of a film\'s structure, not a set of rules for a film to follow or break. The high age rating is there to desperately get folks to care about Sony\'s Marvel films again. They threw in easily replaceable F-bombs and blood in scenes that could have been PG-13 with little editing. That doesn\'t imply that Kraven should water itself down, rather that it does very little to boast its edgy certification.\n\nDespite featuring two big-name actors and occasionally pretty shots, Kraven the Hunter couldn\'t be much blunter. Its main goal appears to keep Sony\'s shiny contract in tip top shape as opposed to making an entertaining movie. Maybe this works at frat parties, but the film is fading from my memory already, so I won\'t bother to put that to the test. I am genuinely struggling to recall much from this film, which is why I am bothering to write my review as soon as I can. But, the biggest question I had about Kraven was this: is it better than Morbius? The answer to that is, shockingly, yes.\n\nKraven the Hunter - 45/100 Kraven the Hunter is occasionally funny, which is unfortunate because it doesn\'t aim to be. TL;DR: Oh, no.', ""6.5 STARS - I enjoyed this overall. It's definitely not the BEST comic book/superhero film I've ever seen, but is it worthy of a 15% average on a site like Rotten Tomatoes? Heck no. It's nowhere near as bad as that. I enjoyed it more than several other types of films like this I've seen, so I'm a little perplexed as to why it's getting such a hugely negative reception. I assume that fans of the comic version of Kraven won't be crazy about the changes made to his character or whatever other liberties have been taken in this story. But for someone not super familiar with Kraven and those in his comic circle, this was a decent enough viewing experience. I like that it took its time with character development and plot and wasn't so action-heavy that I got desensitized to it. Felt like the writers at least tried to come up with a story that had some thought put into it. I'm sure that subsequent viewings might make me notice other issues, but for now I'll just leave it at this. And be glad that at least it didn't piss me off, like some movies have. Video review to come shortly."", ""Tired when in the movies of today spit on the history and characteristics of the characters with which we grew up. Here Kraven goes from being the best hunter of all to a simple murderer. The title should be Kraven the murderer and not Kraven the hunter. Here the references to other characters multiply: Kraven runs like some of the Twilight characters, has vision and ability to run as the Man of the Six Million Dollars, climb trees like Spiderman and curiously has a black interest Like Blade. Not only that; He has a dominant and evil father (like a clon of Kingpin), he has some control over animals (like a Aquaman on earth), a mother with tragic death (again as Blade) and has a brother who will finally make decisions that he will not like ( as in every decent martial arts movie made in China). The most weak character is Kraven; his history, his origin, his motivation, everything is unfortunate, weak, pauperrm. When Russell Crowe is seen, you realize who is the authentic star here; moreover, they should make a prequel telling the story of this character that would be much more interesting than Kraven the loser. The other villains are decent; both the Phoreigner and Rhyno are decent in their representation and especially the protagonist of Rhyno really entertain with his character. No one tells details of his past; We know nothing of them or anyone's present in the film; Everything is cartoon and without content. The only decent, if it can be said, is that in the end the Chamaleon is also distinguished and therefore the story ends with a smile on the face because there is a real satisfaction: in a world of hard characters nobody who embraces improper causes of the greater hunter of the world should highlight. Kraven The Killer is a bad film, very bad but the highlighting of its villains produces pleasure, a very bad pleasure but pleasure after all."", ""I'm watching Kraven the Hunter and I'm halfway through.\n\nKraven is not Kraven, Rhino is not Rhino.\n\nI'm in the second half now, and the movie is becoming even more ridiculous.\n\nIf the movie were titled Sergei the Hunter, it could have been considered a good film, but unfortunately, that's not its name.\n\nIn the original, Kraven isn't a superhero; he's a TV host who hunts every kind of animal to prove his ego and strength.\n\nRhino, in the original, is just a henchman wearing a rhino-skin suit.\n\nThe absurdity of the plot peaks in the second half, and the story is extremely disjointed in terms of context.\n\nSeriously, does no one read these scripts before approving them?\n\nA movie that could have been good, with a talented cast, has been wasted on a nonsensical script, resulting in complete garbage."", ""So i was really hyped for this movie for like two years or so since i heard about it in news, i never read comics so i dont know much and i liked what i saw about this character, something like Lobo from DC.\n\nCasting was good, story was decent, a bit too rushed at moments, a lot of location changes without so much need for it, could've used few more minutes for background story, few more minutes for depths of all main characters..\n\nWhat i miss here is only that depth of the story and main characters, everything else is pretty much there, nicely packed action, good casting, a lot of potential for future (which is kinda pointless since is seems this Sony universe came to and end), decent story.\n\nDefinitely a movie that i would watch again, and that says a lot in this couple of years of movie making which made some really dumb things.\n\n7/10 for hope of a sequel and improvement in it.\n\nMust watch for marvel / dc fans."", ""Kraven the Hunter is a new spin-off set in the Sony, Marvel Spider-Man universe. This spin-off is directed by J. C. Chandor, director of A Most Violent Year and All is Lost.\n\nWhen Kraven (Aaron Taylor Johnson) turns his back on his father Nikolai (Russell Crowe), he trains himself to become one of the best hunters. With natural powers, he has developed a bond with the animals and tries to protect them from the wrong actions of humans.\n\nWhen he finds out that his father is also involved in such wrong things and that his brother Dmitri (Fred Hechinger) is in danger, Kraven must stand up to the wrong things and even his own father, to save the animals and his brother.\n\nDespite the fact that the writers of this script have experience with similar films such as the first Iron Man film or The Equalizer films, this story still seems a bit messy and contains predictable moments. This film, instead of an origin story of a Spider-Man villain, almost comes across as a story of someone trying to protect nature and animals from the wrong actions of humans.\n\nThe visual effects are also not that believable, because most of the animals in the film are CGI-edited in the scenes. In other, older films, they even managed to make CGI animals more believable, which sometimes even makes some of the animals in this film come across as unintentionally funny instead of exciting or sympathetic. Furthermore, most of the green screen is also visible in the film.\n\nThis Sony, Spider-Man spin-off also has a 16+ rating for a change, so it could have been a bit more brutal and bloody. However, the realism and clarity of the actions are sometimes disappointing, because it takes quite a while before the action starts and is often not always clear in the picture, or otherwise does not seem realistic. Like most of the animals, you can also see that most of the blood is fake. The actors' voices also don't always match what their characters are saying, sometimes making it seem like the movie is bad or that they talked over it. Otherwise, it seems like the actors didn't put much effort into their roles. This was also a problem with the previous Spider-Man spin-off Madame Web from earlier this year. Sony seems to have made a wise decision for now, by spending less time and attention on their Spider-Man spin-off films. They will now try to focus more on projects that involve a more Spider-Man character.\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson has trained himself well physically for this role and comes across as just as believable as a more Russian Tarzan, trying to protect the flora and fauna from the dark deeds of humans. Sony has however put him a bit in the shade. In last year's Spider-Man video game, they also used the character of Kraven the Hunter. He just got a better story and more personality. Alessandro Nivola does a fitting job as Kraven's adversary in the story, but his character no longer comes across as realistic due to the poor visual effects in the latter part of the film."", ""I can't wrap my head around why this movie is rated lower than it deserves. Seriously, it's at least a solid 7-star flick in my book! The action scenes are mind-blowing, and the way they were performed just oozes style and creativity. Every punch, every kick-it all felt so dynamic and fresh. I don't know much about the lead actor, but I was super impressed with his charisma and unique style. He's definitely someone I'll be watching more of, so it looks like I've got a few movie nights lined up!\n\nOverall, this movie is a fantastic ride. The plot, the action, the performances-it all clicks. I really hope the filmmakers bless us with a sequel because there's so much potential for this story to continue. It's rare to find a movie that combines style, action, and fun like this one does. If you haven't seen it yet, give it a shot-it's worth the hype!"", 'Alright, apologies already if this review is all over the place but lets start by the whole ""Spider-Manless Spiderverse"". This was a mistake. They SHOULD had included Spider-Man at some point, even if a different one than Tom Holland. Its not surprising the whole idea eventually failed. And they dared teased us in one of the Venom movies too...\n\nAnyway this universe is done now, so just like the DCEU last movies, i doubt Kraven will do good in theatres. But that does not mean its a bad one.\n\nPersonally all i wanted was a brutal, violent, bloody action movie with a Superhero who don\'t care if he killed his ennemies (by now it was obvious none of them were vilains but full on heroes). And i got that.\n\nI enjoyed Aaeron Taylor-Johnson acting and portraying, even if in legacy media i imagine Kraven looking more like a young Russel Crow (wich funny enough actually play his father here). Someone more ""raw"" and less ""pretty"" but still he was really good in the movie.\n\nThe story is rather simple, not much big scales or anything, but i think it serve its purpose. The vilain is also totally fine. He ain\'t no Joker or Thanos of course, but there is a decent ammount of scenes with him and you still get where he comes from.\n\nNow sure the movie is heavy on CGI, and i know for some it can be a turn off, but see it this way, its a Marvel/Sony movie, and his power make it that he moves unaturally. I am happy they got R-Rated and made it very bloody.\n\nYes the CGI still give it a ""cleaner"" look than something wich would had been done in a gritty style in the 90s or even early 2000s with practical effects, but it still retain this violent side.\n\nOverall Kraven was what i wanted. A simple violent action movie about a character i know a bit from source material (but not a ton) and it delivered just that. Expecting more in my opinion would be unrealistic.\n\nThis is no ""Madame Web"" with its ""worst episode of a CW show"" feel. There is PLENTY of action.', 'The film is incredibly average, has no high points, no plot depth, third-rate CGI, illogical plot lines, dialogue that a primary school student could hardly have written worse, and the one who did his job really well, Russel Crow, only appears very briefly. Why can\'t Sony create a decent Marvel film? The villain is more like a character than a bad guy. The filmmakers put zero ambition into making the film and weren\'t serious about it, they shot the film in a hurry to satisfy the film bosses! In the end, the film is a series of ""how, what, why"" questions that remain unanswered! Characters appear whose origins are not explained at all, nor do their appearance make any sense!', ""The continued franchise consisting of Spider-Man foes now comes to Kraven: The Hunter; a confusing, tone deaf, dull, and inoffensively forgetful experience with only some excusable fun to be had.\n\nThe action sequences are all fairly entertaining without being very stylised, with suitably violent kills and standardly choreographed fights. Aaron Taylor-Johnson gives a decent performance as the inaccurately adapted British-accented and heroic Kraven, able to deliver the awkward one liners and silent charisma with bare minimum effort and ease, respectively. Moreover, Russell Crowe gives more of a comic-faithful portrayal of Kraven in his portrayal of the solemnly abusive father Nikolai, and Alessandro Nivola give appropriately over-the-top comical performances as the calculating mob boss Rhino, making up most of the fun to be had aside from the action. And in terms of Rhino's appearance, to say the least it is very much accurate, for better or worse is up to you.\n\nHowever the rest of the film seems to consistently fall apart, with each scene or non-action sequence feeling cobbled together with choppy editing as a result of harsh reshoots, painfully forced ADR, and script changes to an incoherent story. A majority of the acting is very dull, with wooden dialogue paired up with equally wooden delivery. Aside from Taylor-Johnson making for a compelling lead, it's moreso a complete betrayal of the Kraven character, originally the ruthless big-game hunter with little care for protecting the weak. Ariana DeBose comes across as bland and boring as the half baked hero Calypso who, from a writing standpoint, is a morally contradictory individual to the point where she seems to change her mind on a dime to serve the story rather than her sense of character. The story is all over the place as well, with character motivations and main focuses seeming to either become altered in a plot revelation, replaced seemingly inexplicably, or just forgotten all together. And all of this culminates to a final scene that delivers a nonsense ending seeing character on paths that weren't hinted at being set up in the slightest, leaving the audience with a feeling of confusion to the point of near-anger.\n\nOverall, Kraven: The Hunter manages to not be an outright bad movie, with some factors to be considered redeeming in a certain sense. But it's the flaws in the filmmaking and cracks in consistency that inevitably sour the experience throughout."", 'I walked out and my 18 year old son asked me what did I think of it. I told him I employed Morbius better and we laughed.\n\nThe dialog was cheesy.\n\nThe virtual production backgrounds looked lazy and unpolished.\n\nThe action was far and few between.\n\nThe acting was horrible.\n\nI\'m not at all familiar with the Kraven character before this movie or his back story, so I did go in without any expectations.\n\nThe trailer was another case of ""showing the best bits of a movie.""\n\nThroughout it I caught myself Idly looking at the time on my phone, audience watching and taking a slow bathroom break.\n\nIt was definitely a case of sitting through it to see what happens at the end out of sheer curiosity, vs actually being, at any point, entertained.\n\nWait for it to hit streaming for free. I have $51 regrets.', 'The director of ""Margin Call,"" ""All Is Lost,"" ""A Most Violent Year,"" and ""Triple Frontier,"" makes his comeback with 2024\'s ""Kraven: The Hunter."" And I, for one, cannot think of any other reason as to why director J. C. Chandor took this job ($$$$$) besides a pure, undiluted passion for the source material. Truly. No other explanation comes to mind.\n\nNow, all joking and cynicism aside, the direction here is the least of this movie\'s problems - in fact, J. C. actually crafts a visually appealing film here with some truly cinematic shots and sequences. Legitimately, I could sense his passion for - if not the material itself - the aesthetic and atmosphere of the film. The cinematography has a certain slickness to it that\'s both visually appealing and dark, dour, and downtrodden, making the movie feel slightly more adult and mature than your usual superhero fare. So, credit where it\'s due - at least ""Kraven"" looks good.\n\nThe action, too, is serviceable - filled with slick, ""John Wick""-esque action, ""Kraven: The Hunter"" has its bursts of violence that add some entertainment value. This is an R-rated film through and through, and if you enjoy R-rated action a la ""The Expendables"" or ""Rambo: Last Blood,"" you\'ll find something to like here, for the most part. My only real complaint about the action is that it\'s edited extremely quickly, emulating the style of ""John Wick"" (the first one, more specifically"" and the Bourne franchise (the latter films, more specifically). There\'s a fair amount of blood and gore here - thankfully - but the editing never really lingers on the carnage; it\'s all edited in a such a way that if you blink, you truly may miss a shot of bloody violence. That said, the action isn\'t incomprehensible or hard to follow - you\'ll be able to tell what\'s happening and who it\'s happening to - it\'s just fast. But even so, the action is fun to watch; Kraven\'s animalistic fighting style is brutal and high-octane, and there\'s a number of exciting sequences that had me grinning from ear to ear.\n\nTrue to Sony\'s recent reputation when it comes to these Spider-Man spinoff films, ""Kraven"" is noticeably cheesy - and this is where the potential negatives come into play. Firstly, I do want to say that if you expected a genuinely good and high quality film, I\'m not sure why you went to see a movie titled ""Kraven: The Hunter."" I mean, you know what you\'re getting into when seeing this movie, which is some fun action and, well, not much else. ""Kraven"" has awful, cringy dialogue and mediocre acting, the kind that makes you feel second-hand embarrassment while sitting in the theatre. However, awful dialogue and mediocre acting are status quo for Sony\'s films, and are even part of the charm at this point - in other words, expect the expected, and you\'ll walk away (somewhat) satisfied.\n\nHonestly, the more I think about this movie the more I appreciate it. I\'m a sucker for cheesy action films, and that\'s exactly what ""Kraven"" is. The plot leaves something to be desired, but you\'re not watching something like this for the plot - you\'re watching it to see someone murder people in various, increasingly brutal ways. And sure, the titular Kraven is barely a villain here - in fact, in no universe can you imagine this version of Kraven ever going after Spider-Man - but if you put that aside, I think you can watch this and not hate yourself afterward. If you know what you\'re getting into, ""Kraven: The Hunter"" can give you two hours of entertainment on a lazy, rainy night.', ""'Kraven The Hunter' is quite poor. Personally, I liked it a little more than 'Venom: The Last Dance' but I would not place it much higher.\n\nAron Taylor Johnson is probably the best part of this. Most of the dialogue is awkward and many actors in this struggle to make it work. You can honestly get quite a few laughs from the way certain actors deliver their dialogue! Honestly, having mafia/criminal gangs have super powers (without having a superhero counter) is quite an interesting idea. I hope this idea can be executed a little better in future attempts.\n\nThe CGI is shaky at best and downright awful at worst. Furthermore, the cinematography and editing is lacklustre. I cannot recommend this, but you may get some enjoyment out of it if you look hard enough."", ""Aaron Taylor Johnson was superb/shredded for the titular role despite any flaws the action is the best aspect by far; I understand the hate but the film is great fun entertainment and J. C. Chandor is very talented especially for other projects I enjoyed the bulk of Kraven! I don't know how Aaron did some of the chase sequences or how the special effects team did it they were awesome. The story is mixed for sure and a little bit felt boring that's probably the only complaints I have. I would definitely say this is better than some Marvel films the last few years to me deserves than the 5.4 rating on here."", ""Kraven the Hunter is the closest a Sony Marvel project has got to being actually good but it still has so many problems to prevent it from achieving that low bar. It's got lacklustre action sequences that make it kinda boring in places, worsened by the disjointed structure stitched together with noticeably bad ADR and CGI to create the final nail in this cinematic universe's coffin. Finally having one of these commit to an R rating is appreciated without helping solve the usual issues.\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson quips more than expected whilst being a generically cool leading man who is convincing enough in his badassery. Ariana DeBose isn't great although the nothing character and clunky exposition really doesn't give her much to work with. Alessandro Nivola is doing a lot of weird things as the surprisingly small Rhino which definitely makes him the most watchable actor here and Russell Crowe's dips in and out of the film like an afterthought with a dodgy accent.\n\nIt's depressing to see a director as accomplished as J. C. Chandor reduced to making a film this bad. His previous experience brings some competency however it's nowhere near enough to offset the awful dialogue, confused plotting and steady string of hilariously bad moments. Even though it's operating more as an action movie in the vein of something like The Equalizer it still culminates in an overblown CG heavy third act and the score is a nonentity until the very end."", 'Well done and very enjoyable movie, acting and action are at their best.\n\nIf you like wildelife and nature, you will appreciate a character that is protective of these values.\n\nThe actors do a good job to be unique and not a run of the mill super hero movie.\n\nThe movie gets better as it progresses and at some times have by the edge of your seat, of course you have the great actor Russell Crow perform very nicely.\n\nSo if you don t want a cheesy run of the mill superhero movie, Kraven is a good option.\n\nI hope we see more of the characters in the movie.\n\nI am not sure why the negative reviews????', ""Not as bad as I thought it would be. It's got a few effective moments. The action sequences are entertaining enough to keep your attention. Aaron Taylor Johnson was a badass and made up for terrible writing and an overdone story. There was no real flow to the storyline, which felt forced.\n\nSynopsis: Kraven the Hunter is the action-packed, R-rated, standalone story of how one of Marvel's most iconic villains came to be. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays Kraven, a man whose complex relationship with his ruthless gangster father, Nikolai Kravinoff (Russell Crowe), starts him down a path of vengeance with brutal consequences, motivating him to become not only the greatest hunter in the world, but also one of its most feared."", ""What is so bad about Kraven? Is it the dialogue between friends and family that sounds so false it seems to be written by AI? Is it the inane plot that makes no sense other than employ animal motifs? Is it the need to suspend belief and enter this cartoon world? Is it the unnecessary hyper violence? Is it the exposition dumps because the writing and director have no idea what they're doing? Well yes, they add to the annoyance, but the overriding things is that this so called entertainment is boring that as it plods over the 2 hour length it becomes tiresome and exhausting. Predictably, the end suggest a sequel. This is entertainment swill."", ""This movie was abysmally terrible! The acting and script was awful , clunky and boring. The storytelling through the scenes was so disjointed , It felt like Aquaman cousin just made a cameo in a 12+ dora the explorer live action movie. The biggest mistake of this film was quite clearly down to the producers and directors they chose to made this movie. Whoever, made the final decisions on this film has zero experience in film and TV industry, especially in directing storytelling. I hope Sony feels incredibly embarrassed, it's even worse than some of the marvel movies that came out in the 1990's.

Usually in tearjerkers there's a climax or an intense scene charged with emotions that triggers your tears but in this movie, however, it ended up being the simplest of scenes-a mere dialogue or an action from the characters-that got my tears flowing without me even realising. Even hours after the movie I was still in my emotions, thinking back of all the little details buried within the film.\n\nNothing in this film screams an intentional attempt to make the audience cry. There was no over-the-top dramatic miscommunication or scenes where it aims to be sad for the sake of being sad. The story is realistic and ordinary, a mirror of countless asian families out there. It portrays the family dynamics so well and I think that's what makes it hit home so hard. The acting of the actors involved was top-notch as well."", ""I watched it yesterday and I always cry every time I see Amah's scene with M, this film reminds me of my grandmother and also this film is very relatable to my life. At the beginning of the scene I felt bored with this film, but in the middle and even approaching the ending, that's when I shed a lot of tears. This film not only sends a sad message, but we (the audience) are also given a feeling of curiosity, joy, and even annoyance. If you want to watch a film with a family theme, you have to watch this film because you will definitely feel what is in this film. The chemistry of the actors can also bring the audience into that atmosphere."", ""It has been a while since I cried watching a movie. It depicts the nuances of familial relationships and mortality that I could highly relate to, surprisingly. The development of M's relationship with his grandmother was done beautifully. I enjoyed the quiet moments, the moments where they shared laughter and grew closer. I enjoyed the acting and cinematography so much, as well as the background music that accompanied the scenes. The story was written in such a way that imparted the importance of loving and caring for one's parents and relatives without being pretentious. I really liked the ending and it was nice to see that the whole family visited Ah Ma's grave during Qing Ming."", ""This is your decent heartwarming family drama film. This film got a lot of hype around me, so i got high expectation before watching this. I was ready to bawl my eyes out after finishing this film, but i was wrong. Maybe i put too much of expectation into this film.\n\nThe story is 'Okay', i love both of the main characters who giving this story the 'live'. The supporting cast for me is too underdeveloped and needed a bit more light to it. The Grandma and her grandson, M, really did a great job in conveying this story to the audiences.\n\nThe looks and vibes are realistic and logic. The visualisation for the Thai community is very well preserved and i give it high praise."", 'My face is soaked in tears when this movie end.\n\nThis movie remind me some moment I almost forgot about grandma. Every moment in movie so relate to me.\n\nMy family has experience like character do. I have uncle like ""Soi"" and his behaviour is same as character too.\n\nIn my opinion this isn\'t best movie but this movie is goood enough to pull your memories and blend it to story. Simply but emotional (If you relate with movie). Less but more.\n\nIf you expect complicate storyline or Doesn\'t understand about Thai / Chinese culture, You\'ll be disappointed.\n\nHope you enjoyed this movie as I do.\n\nThanks for read this review.', 'Esteemed film critic Roger Ebert once declared that movies are towering empathy generating machines, a statement I wholeheartedly embraced and there is no better demonstration of this phenomenon than with How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies. The see-saw of emotions and the rollercoaster of feels, what a ride it was!\n\nWriter-director Pat Boonnitipat didn\'t even try to reinvent the wheel. You know exactly what will happen in the end; there is no final miracle cure (here\'s looking at you, Queen of Tears), there is no ""it is always darkest before the dawn"" ending and there is no final twist (there is a kind of twist but Choo whispered to me what the twist will be an hour before it dropped and she was of course correct. How does she do this every time?), but this is testament to great storytelling in that you don\'t need any twists and turns, flashy cinematography, full orchestration, CGI dream sequence or the whole shebang to serve up a scrumptious dish of the feels. You just need authenticity without any artifice.\n\nThe movie\'s greatest asset is its relatability. If you are born into an Asian family with ancestral roots that stretch wide and beyond, you will sense the familiarity with all the characters. Perhaps you will see manifestations of your relatives and family members here - the long-suffering daughter, the son who feels problems that can be solved by money are not problems, the calculative daughter-in-law, the good-for-nothing son and the kid whose eyes are glued to the computer screen. The story is fictional but it feels true to life with its keen observation of family dynamics when the death of the matriarch is imminent and the vultures start to circle. Grandma isn\'t stupid, she knows why she is the centre of attention and even M is not spared when she says to him: ""you are also sowing seeds in hope of reaping them right?""\n\nCredit has to be bestowed upon the actors who breathed life into their characters. I am surprised this is Usha Seamkhum first acting role. She is such a natural without a single smidgen of artifice. Putthipong ""Billkin"" Assaratanakul is the perfect foil to Amah\'s no nonsense approach to life. You will follow his arc fervently knowing he will wise up to the ways of life and when that moment arrives it is so subtle that you know it is an accumulation of Amah\'s many interactions with him.\n\nThough the plot is straightforward I doubt anyone will find this boring. As it steamrolls towards the inevitable ending, it will happen - your tears will flow, but know that every rivulet will be well-earned just like every peal of laughter. Incidentally, this is currently the highest grossing film in Thailand and Indonesia, evidence that it has resonated with many audiences.\n\nThis is that rare film that Choo and I were still talking about over breakfast this morning probably because we didn\'t want the magic to dissipate, desperately trying to hang on to the tendrils of a heartfelt story. You will be surprised that we can still unearth vignettes of truth after a good night of sleep like a quick scene of a monk in a wheelchair at the chemo clinic as if to suggest that sickness affect everyone, including the religiously pious ones or the scene where Amah goes to meet her estranged brother to borrow money for a burial plot. My theory is that Amah already knows the outcome but she still wanted M to learn a hard life lesson.\n\nSchool is out. Forget about taking your kids to The Garfield Movie, instead take them to see this. Don\'t be ashamed to let them see you cry and laugh heartily. After the movie, sit down somewhere and over a warm drink, share stories about your mother, their grandma. I think for a few minutes, she will be alive in everybody\'s memory.', ""Watched it yesterday. It's one of the greatest films in my recent memory.\n\nEverything in this film is so relatable and is very real. I cried and I couldn't stop myself from tearing up from the first 30 minutes of the movies until the very end. The message is so strong and Bilkin, Grandma and the rest of the casts just did something we call 'Magical' in the world of the acting.\n\nCinematography is also on point. It looked real, but also artistic and very cinematic. This will resonate in every viewer hearts for so long and the tearing effect will stay hours after finished the film.\n\nIt's not often that the people in the whole theater cried and sobbed their hearts out like this. One of a very magical moment for the whole 2 hours."", ""Watched this movie in Thailand with EN subtitles. I am neither Chinese nor Thai.\n\nGreat movies evoke emotions in audiences from across the world, regardless of whether they have personally experienced the same situation(s) as the protagonist. Think Forrest Gump, Green Mile, Schindler's List and their ilk.\n\nAverage movies like this one evoke emotions only when audiences are reminded of their own experience (i.e. Chinese familes in Southeast Asia and beyond) who consider this movie a teary experience. For other audiences that are neither Chinese nor Thai (like me), the movie is simply material of interest and curiosity, somewhat like a cultural documentary.\n\nThis film sadly fits in the latter - average. Great acting, but there is nothing in the storyline or acting that particularly stirs the emotions of an outsider to the protagonist's culture."", ""Excellently made, well executed film about a story close to our hearts, or atleast those who's fortunate enough to have a grandmother in their lives. Ties you in to the characters so effortlessly with each individuals unique, yet common traits and characteristics that we somehow have one in our own families. With their own agendas within the story and how everybody is coping/plotting for the inevitable.\n\nA common theme in Asian households, what happens when the head of the house passes? As the eldest grandchild seeking to seize the opportunity of a lifetime, somehow rekindled something beautiful along the way.\n\nSo proud with how far the ASEAN film industry has come, and the future is looking even brighter after this ethereal masterpiece."", 'While we don\'t watch that many Thai films, Pat Boonnitipat\'s feature debut, ""How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies"", is a sweet and tasty touch of Thainess that beautifully captures the essence of family and what\'s really important in life. The film is a culturally relatable story, with lovely visuals and an authentic portrayal of family dynamics as they navigate the impending death of their grandmother. As the characters deal with their own desires and their relationships, the audience is drawn into the journey, reflecting on the universal themes of family, loss, and redemption. By the end, I had tears in my eyes, and a renewed appreciation for the fleeting moments that make life meaningful.', ""The movie doesn't try to impose love. Or try to blatantly bring tears to your eyes. It's unlike any movie you've ever seen. But using realistic storytelling, there are both jokes and heart-warming situations. The kind of tension that cannot be exaggerated. Through actors who are very suitable for the role The main character of the story, the grandmother, is so realistic that it makes us think of our own grandmother. Other actors who played their roles realistically It made Dra realize that every family must have a character like this. Therefore, there is never a moment where the audience feels that This scene is a scene intended to be dramatic. Miraculously makes us conform."", 'Lahn Mah / How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies (2024) : Brief Review -\n\nEmotional absorption of this Thai tale is super effective, if not the ""plot."" Lahn Mah is one of the most emotionally absorbing movies from the foreign cinema this year, and as humans, we all should have no problems connecting with it. However, the effective crafting of the ""plot"" (that\'s a double meaning word here) could have taken it much above what it has turned out to be, if done better. Also, it\'s a very slow film, so you might want to rethink about the repeat viewing. The film is about Mengju, an old woman suffering from stomach cancer. A college dropout, M, greedily volunteers to become Mengju\'s carer, hoping to inherit her estate. During this process, he grows close to her, and she also starts liking him. M wants to sell her house but doesn\'t succeed. One of Mengju\'s sons shows up to take care of her, but she denies and prefers to live with M. However, after a while, M is left disheartened when Mengju gives the deed of her house to Soei. After parting ways, M comes back home, and Mengju is taken to a nursing home. M meets and brings her to his house before she could take her last breath. What will M get after all? You\'ll get the answer in the climax, and you\'ll know why I used ""plot"" in the headline. It definitely leaves you emotional since we all have that bonding with our grandparents and vice versa. This relationship starts when we are kids and then are in their 40-50s; it ends when we are in our 30s and they are in the 80s. In our childhood, they take care of us, and in their last days, we have to take care of them. Simple emotions, simple equations, and simple words make it effective. The film lacks enough pacing, though, which bores you a little. Nonetheless, it\'s a good watch for young audiences as well as their parents and grandparents. But yes, it could have been better. Half a star extra for that ""bond.""\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.', ""For me\nThe story is all over the place.\n\n\nThe music try too hard to make scene more dramatic. It works, but since the story isn't, it feel disconnected.\n\n\nQuite misleading title. The title suggest a grand journey and effort to achieve a dream for the love one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf watching this movie only for tear jerking, I suggest sleep 110 minutes, and enjoy the last 15 minutes. The acting, the bgm, and the framing is enough to get emotional, no need story."", '""How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies"" is a profound exploration of familial obligations and the mercurial nature of human motives, wrapped in the veneer of a tear-jerking, heart-rending drama. This film deftly navigates the juxtaposition of comedy and tragedy, evoking laughter and tears in equal measure.\n\nThe protagonist, M, is a teenage university dropout who chases the elusive dream of becoming a successful gamecaster, only to be met with the harsh realities of an oversaturated market. His aspirations take a desperate turn when he sees his young cousin, Mui, inherit a mansion worth tens of millions after caring for her dying grandfather, Agong. In an almost Machiavellian pivot, M volunteers to care for his terminally ill grandmother, Amah, hoping for a similar windfall.\n\nWhat ensues is a poignant narrative that delves into the complex dynamics of a Southeast Asian family. The film does not shy away from the intricate web of expectations, disappointments, and unspoken bonds that define familial relationships in this cultural context. It reflects a reality that is both specific to its setting and universally relatable.\n\nOne of the film\'s strengths lies in its ability to blend humor with sorrow. The one-liner punchlines provide brief respites from the otherwise heavy subject matter, allowing the audience to experience a full spectrum of emotions. This balance is masterfully achieved, with the audience often laughing and crying in the same breath.\n\nFor me, the film resonated on a deeply personal level. Having experienced the heartache of a loved one battling cancer, I found the scenes depicting M\'s care for his Amah strikingly reminiscent of my own life. The routine of medical checkups, the silent fears, and the small moments of joy amidst the suffering were portrayed with a realism that is seldom seen on screen. It was as though a slice of my own life drama had been projected onto the film, making the viewing experience both cathartic and profoundly moving.\n\nThe film also incorporates references to Chinese traditions or taboos, which add layers of cultural authenticity. These elements are not just decorative but serve to deepen the narrative, highlighting the superstitions and traditional beliefs that shape the characters\' actions and decisions.\n\nAt its core, ""How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies"" is a commentary on family values and the fading tradition of caring for one\'s elders. It poignantly depicts the erosion of this once-sacred duty, as older generations find themselves increasingly isolated in their twilight years. This theme is brought to life with a nostalgic realism that will resonate with many, particularly those who have witnessed this societal shift firsthand.\n\n""How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies"" is a film that transcends its narrative, offering a rich tapestry of emotions, cultural insights, and philosophical musings. It is a reminder of the enduring power of family, the complexities of human motives, and the bittersweet nature of life itself.', ""If you're keen on learning about different cultures, this film offers a fascinating glimpse into Thai traditions and is definitely worth watching.\n\nI'm neither Thai nor Chinese, but I like this movie. You don't have to relate to the story to find this movie interesting, but if you enjoy learning about other cultures, you will likely appreciate it.\n\nIt presents a striking contrast between Asian and Western values. In many Asian cultures, there's an expectation for children to inherit from their parents, even if the parents aren't wealthy. In contrast, Western children often strive for independence and aren't as concerned about inheriting their parents' assets if their parents aren't rich.\n\nThe film also highlights how Asian cultures tend to prioritize caring for elderly parents over placing them in nursing homes, which is a common practice in the West. The storyline revolves around a grandchild's desire to claim their grandmother's inheritance, and the resolution is compelling as the grandchild ultimately learns that money isn't everything.\n\nUnlike many Thai films that feature beautiful, often Westernized actors or plastic surgery-enhanced faces, this film presents actors who are authentically Thai, with natural performances. The settings are refreshingly unpolished, depicting messy homes and crowded spaces that add to the film's realism rather than the often overly artistic settings of other Asian films.\n\nThe film is a drama with a somewhat slow plot, so watching it on Netflix in installments might be more enjoyable to avoid boredom. Overall, it's a poignant exploration of cultural values and family dynamics, offering a genuine portrayal of Thai life."", ""M is a great thai actor and who ever plays the role of the grandma really did a great job. It is a must to watch movie for everyone. I recently watched this as of writing my reviews about this trending movie here in the Philippines. This movie and the characters really made me mad, laugh, and most specially it made me cry. It made me mad because of those person who really wanted to earn an easy money, to those person who even really doesn't care much of their relatives or family members. It made me laugh to both of the main characters, it really made me cry because I don't want that to happen to me, that the only reason why they are taking care of someone because of their personal motives."", '""How To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies""\n\nFirst time watching a drama flick with a full house theater.

With the hopes of being a millionaire, he had the idea from his ""cute"" cousin Mui how to be one. The time he spent taking care of his grandmother may not have changed his initial plan all along right away but the plot twist in the end takes the cake.\n\n""Even a traitor may mend. I know one that did""\n\nThe story itself is sad already but the acting, the sound editing, the pacing, overall directing just makes this movie even better. It is true that you\'ll have to prepare a tissue paper or a handkerchief to wipe your tears as this is truly a tearjerker film.\n\nA movie not just good with the quality but also reminds us of how family is important and that kind of love that truly comes from the heart.\n\nHow To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies is a 9/10 for me. As some say, this is an Oscar worthy film\n\n#HowToMakeMillionsBeforeGrandmaDies.', ""If you could say that, the outline of the story of the film How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies is about the drama of Amah's legacy before she died. However, the inheritance drama was not made too dramatic like what we often see in soap operas. The thing is, the process of M trying to get Amah's inheritance is wrapped in comedy.\n\nThis is because the character M, who is famous for being cool, always has various silly ways to capture Amah's heart and make her laugh. However, on the other hand, the storytelling in this film also succeeded in making the audience touched because they saw the closeness of M and Amah.\n\nAfter being made to laugh from the start of the film, we will be presented with moments that feel emotional and can make the audience cry towards the end. If you could say that, How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies has a storytelling formula that is similar to GDH films in general."", ""If you are Chinese, or have anything to do with the race and understand it, this movie is definitely a worthy watch.

You can really see how well the director portrayed the story. I only expected myself to tear occasionally. I did not expect myself to sob this badly.

His grandma is not that gullible and senses his intentions; however, M does not give up and still unaware, he sets off on a journey of an important transformation, which is at the heart of this brilliant picture.\n\nThe film is a mixture of a family comedy and a sentimental drama; it is wise and witty without being too sophisticated.

The second half is particularly easy to cry (and the aftertaste is also very strong), especially in the last ten minutes (the male protagonist's transition from now to childhood is filmed very well!). Although the main characters are Thai Chinese, it feels like they are filming Chinese families, and it also explores East Asian family relationships and the topic of valuing sons over daughters (the sentence that the male protagonist's mother said to his grandmother had a profound impact on me).

I find it more enjoyable than the Korean ""Parasites"" although technically this film is not as good. Personally, I don\'t feel much sadness throughout. A few scenes are really smart and funny but the last 10 to 15 minutes I felt very touched. I think Western audience will find it refreshing and more touching. The young actor is good.

I anticipated a light-hearted comedy, but what unfolded was an almost flawless family drama.\n\nThe narrative primarily unfolds in the Chinatown district of Bangkok, centering on Menju as she navigates her affairs following a cancer diagnosis. Unbeknownst to her, the entire family was aware of Menju\'s condition before she was. Consequently, M. Attempts to breach the emotional barrier with Nana by revealing what no one else dared to say. Unfortunately for M., Menju is quite set in her ways, making it challenging for her to trust and recognize her family members for who they truly are. Nevertheless, she engages in the process, one episodic interaction at a time. Meanwhile, M. Finds himself growing closer to Menju, inadvertently stepping into the caregiver role that he initially embraced on a whim. Other family members, particularly M.\'s mother Sew (Sarinrat ""Jear\' Thomas) and his uncle Kiang (Sanya ""Duu"" Kunakurn), dedicate more time and attention to Menju. However, it is M. Who forcefully integrates himself into Menju\'s life, ultimately leading her to accept her family.\n\nA significant portion of ""How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies"" focuses on M.\'s personal development. We accompany him as he begins to perceive the world as a broader entity, while its existence beyond his own life and experiences is consistently highlighted. This is evident in the ambient sounds of the film\'s soundtrack, featuring the gentle patter of rain and the cheerful chirping of birds, as well as in the streets, stairwells, and corridors that Menju traverses and M. Follows.\n\nThis film is a poignant tear-jerker that transcends that label! I relished every moment, and I was astonished at how quickly the two hours flew by. This is a must-see! It stands as a true gem in director Pat Boonnitipat\'s debutant oeuvre.', ""The hype surrounding this movie might be somewhat overstated. While I enjoyed it, it didn't quite live up to the glowing reviews I had read. Perhaps I set my expectations too high, or maybe I was just emotionally detached. I was particularly moved by the scene where the money the grandmother lent for years is finally used for her grave. Billkin gave a remarkable performance, and Amah also stood out as key characters. Their interactions, especially their bickering, added a layer of sentimental charm. Though it might seem trivial to some, there's a certain magic to these moments that resonated with me."", ""For sure, this film broke my skepticism towards Thai films.\n\nThere are many reasons why you should love this film. I like how the cinematography moves as well as the ambience of a lonely old woman's life. When beautiful background sound (especially at the end of the film) is crucial to building a solid story and characters with a lot of meaning that really provides a meaningful new viewing experience.\n\nThere are many things that can be criticized about this film, especially some scenes that feel unnecessary. Maybe for some people the first few hours will feel boring. However, if you put yourself out there, you will eventually believe it.\n\nMaybe in the future I will look for similar Thai films that are as good as this."", ""This Thai film has captured hearts across Asia, becoming a major box-office hit. ❤\n\nIt tells the story of a young guy named M, who starts off as pretty indifferent to his grandmother, Amah. But when she's diagnosed with terminal cancer, everything changes for him.\n\nAt first, M is just looking at the potential inheritance, but as he spends more time with Amah, he starts to genuinely care for her.

You see her strength and how much she values her time with M, even knowing his initial motives.\n\nThe mix of humor and heartfelt moments makes this film special. It really drives home the idea that true wealth isn't about money but about the love and connections we have with our family."", ""Great movie. Emotional Core: The movie should focus on the relationship between the protagonist and the grandmother. It could explore themes of love, family, and legacy, showing the emotional journey of both characters as they navigate their limited time together. Humor and Heart: The film could balance serious moments with humor, especially if it involves quirky, funny attempts by the protagonist to make money quickly. This could range from failed business ventures to hilarious misunderstandings, adding levity to the story. A Surprising Twist: Toward the climax, the grandmother might reveal that she knew about the protagonist's efforts all along and shares her own wisdom about life, money, and what it truly means to live fully."", 'This movie is one of the most touching movie I have watched in a while. It is such a surprise. The story is funny, emotional, and incredibly real, especially in the moments between M and grandma. It starts off feeling like a story about chasing money, but it quickly becomes something deeper. At its core, it holds so much more than can be expressed. The lessons hit you right in the heart. I definitely teared up alot throughout the movie. It was simple, heartfelt and unforgettable. I hope more and more people watch this film. Truly amazing! The is is a movie that feels personal on so many levels, like it is speaking to you directly.', ""A friend recommended this me, and because I have always been in awe of any work Billkin is in, I decided to watch it. I didn't expect the kind of emotional impact this movie would have on me. Have you ever sat in a theater and heard people just sobbing around you? Not the polite kind of sniffling, not the kind of crying you do in public. Literally sobbing. I had never experienced it before either. Nothing could have prepared me for this. This movie is a gem. Family is always such a complex issue. To view family as transactional is something taboo in Asian cultures, but it happens more often than we would like to admit. Coming from the kind of community where family values are so highly upheld yet familial relationships can be so complicated and strained, this movie punched me right in the gut. It articulated all the stuff I had been taught not to even think or say about my family. At the same time, there was love. There is so much love in this movie. Love, not like a second chance, but a million chances after that. Love that makes /you/ better, love that makes you /love/ better, love that makes you /do/ better.\n\nWhen M starts looking after his grandma, he is mostly doing it for selfish reasons. It's not to say that he doesn't love her, but he also knows what he wants out of this situation. Slowly, slowly, he becomes a part of her daily life, her routine. He wants to get closer to her, he wants to make sure she realises that he's the one doing the most for her, so that when the time comes to get the benefits, he is first in line. His motive his clear, his plan is in action. But who can put in so much effort without changing at least a little bit themselves? M and his grandma's life together is a little awkward, a little humorous, a little regretful. After all, so much time has passed. And there's no that much time left. But they still learn new things about each other. Sometimes, the people who are supposed to be closest to you in blood end up knowing you the least. Because we know this person is always going to be in our lives, we might not truly put in the effort to sustain that relationship. Often, things like effort in love are associated with grand gestures of romantic love. But this movie shows that you can put in effort in family, too. You can get to know your grandmother, too. It is hard to remember that someone was a person before they became a parent or grandmother, but if you're lucky, like M might be, you might be get to know your grandmother before she was your grandmother, too.\n\nA grandparent's love can often feel so burdensome. Not in the way that you don't want it, but in the way that it feels shameful to have someone love you as the best of you even when you're actually one selfish adult. And it's not that they don't know. Often, they have raised you, so they knew you as a child before you learned that you had be careful with the way you put yourself in the world. All your little bad habits, they probably already know. But you're still their grandchild. You're still someone they want to eat with. Gosh, food in this movie is such a Big and Important Thing and I resonate with this so much. Every major cultural festival, your family will gather around the same table. It won't always be a happy thing, but eating together is a way of staying together, too. And how many of us have been loved by our grandparents and taken that love back with us in four Tupperware containers filled to the brim with food?\n\nI don't have words to describe just how full of life this movie is. So full of grief and laughter. The grief in the laughter, the laughter in the grief. Because how else do you deal with grief and death, this ridiculous idea that we are all here on limited time? It's an absurd situation. One day you are little and you have all the time in the world. One day you don't. How do we come to terms with it without laughing at it like it's some bad joke? There is so much laughter in this movie. You will laugh one second and cry the next. This movie does not mince it's words, it's scenes. All of it is shown to the full extent. All the regret you can't deny. All the love you can't deny. Sometimes, you get a second chance to do better. Sometimes, you are a child holding your grandmother's hand and then you grow up so big and twisted. But you can still hold your grandmother's hand. Being scolded, seeing the people you be disappointed in you, these are not good feelings. But it's worse when people continue loving you anyway. And in movie, love continues.\n\nBillkin is a force to reckon with. He embodies M so well you can feel every little gesture of his body language. I knew it already, having seen him in ITSAY, but gosh, it takes my breath away still. It is impossible not to feel for M, to feel with him, to cry and laugh with him. And Usha Seamkhum... I was really surprised to find out she wasn't an actress because, what? Her role as grandma felt so real that I kept thinking back to my own grandmas. She felt so familiar. Together, they have made something so special. I felt like I was a child again when I was watching this. At the same time, I felt like I was the selfish adult. A movie that lets you feel the complex web of feelings without moralising any of them. A movie that makes you believe in family, whatever family might mean to you. And that people really can do better. Sometimes you get a chance to make it right and you really make it right. I want to believe that.\n\nPlease watch this movie! You will absolutely not regret it. Make sure to have tissues ready. Lots of them. And your phone beside you, in case you have the urge to call home."", ""Thai family melodrama about a grandson who decides to accompany the last months of his grandmother's life, terminally ill with cancer, out of financial interest, to discover, after all, a rich relationship, of mutual respect and dedication, which far exceeds any inheritance advantage.\n\nAn insightful reflection on modern society, on the breakdown of family relationships and on how much is lost, with the lack of communication between generations and the frequent condemnation of older people to degrading loneliness.\n\nA beautiful film, easily tear-jerking, but still with a very human content, which expresses a true life lesson."", ""Never in my life have I seen a movie that hit me more than this one. There were so many emotions during this film. I laughed, cried, understood and it felt that for the first time ever I truly saw how special and important family is.\n\nThe way everything was captured made the film unique and special. Whenever there was an important scene it was not only beautifully captured on camera, but the music made the scenes even stronger. Sometimes happy, sometimes sad. I also love the fact that they used more instrumental music. I haven't seen many movies like that. I also have to say that nothing was rushed. It all felt very natural and it was very pleasant that you also had time to think about certain situations, because the scenery was very calm.\n\nThe acting was superb. I could feel every emotion, every thought and when somebody laughed or cried, I laughed and cried as well. When somebody acted a certain way, I could always relate to it. Sometimes with my own life, but sometimes also with people who are close to me.\n\nSo in conclusion, don't hesitate. This movie is worth the watch!"", 'Honestly this movie will forever be memorable to me, ive watched this 2 times in the cinema and 1 time outside, and im telling you, each time i rewatches this movie, i teared up even more, it feels even heartbreaking somehow cause now you noticed more and more details each rewatches, i would def rewatch this again other day cause i just rewatched this 2 days ago and it successfully making me sob like crazy, i dont care if people think this is not sad, but for me this is my number 1 saddest movie, and ive watched a lottt of sad movies but nothing can compete with this, i cried in soooo many scenes, best.', ""I honestly can't even remember the last time a movie made me cry, but this one hit me in a way I didn't expect. As it reached the final moments, I tried so hard to man up and hold back the tears, but the storytelling was so powerful that it completely broke me. The naration, building up all that emotion, it was impossible to stop. Before I knew it, I was bawling, crying hysterically\n\nIt's rare for a film to leave such a deep emotional impact, but this one did. It's easily one of the best movies I've seen in years-an unforgettable experience.\n\nGotta try more international movies after this, maybe Ill find a masterpiece again."", ""Lahn Mah is a beautifully crafted film that captivates on multiple levels, offering a deeply emotional yet uplifting experience. From the opening scenes, the film establishes a strong narrative that immerses you in its warmth and sincerity. The storytelling is rich and layered, with a perfect balance of lighthearted moments and heartfelt drama.\n\nOne particularly touching scene takes place when the characters gather for a family dinner, where their shared laughter and subtle glances communicate volumes about their relationships. The director masterfully uses these quieter moments to build a sense of closeness, creating a bond between the audience and the characters. It's in these tender, everyday scenes that Lahn Mah shines brightest, allowing the emotional weight to build gradually.\n\nThe music throughout Lahn Mah is a standout element, setting the tone for each scene without overpowering the narrative. The score blends traditional and contemporary sounds, enhancing the film's atmosphere and complementing the emotional arcs of the characters. Whether it's a soft, melodic background during a reflective moment or a more uplifting piece in a joyous scene, the music feels like an integral part of the storytelling.\n\nThe performances are another highlight. Every actor fully embodies their character, delivering nuanced portrayals that feel authentic and deeply connected to the film's themes of love, family, and tradition. In one particularly moving scene, the characters share their hopes and dreams, and the quiet vulnerability in their voices is both touching and relatable. The chemistry between the actors makes these moments even more poignant, drawing you deeper into the story.\n\nBy the end of Lahn Mah, I found myself emotionally invested in each character's journey. The film's ability to evoke such strong feelings, without ever feeling forced or overly sentimental, is a testament to its powerful direction and writing. It's the kind of movie that leaves a lasting impression, making you reflect on the beauty of simple moments and the connections we share with others.\n\nLahn Mah is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates heartfelt cinema, combining masterful storytelling, unforgettable performances, and a stunning musical score that elevates the film's emotional depth. It's a cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll."", ""To me the movie felt like a felt like sitting by the ocean on a cloudy day, calm and quiet, but the wave that comes in slowly stirs up something deeper. It's not the kind of movie that throws a lot at you-no big action, no over-the-top drama. Everything about it is calm and steady, like waves just gently rolling in. It doesn't hit you with emotions all at once but kind of sneaks up on the watcher in the best way\n\nThe story feels so real, like you're watching life unfold naturally. It's not trying too hard to make you cry or laugh-it just... *is*. And somehow, that makes it even more touching. You start to feel everything slowly, and by the end, By the end, it's like you've been slowly, gently cracked open, leaving you reflecting on your own life and the people you care about.\n\nIt's one of those movies that leaves the watcher feeling warm and reflective, it's sad but not in a way that feels heavy. Simple, gentle, but very meaningful.\n\nWhat also stands out is how perfectly all the elements in the movie complement each other. The setting, the music, the characters-everything fits together in just the right way.\n\nEach character has their moment to shine, and no one feels like they're overshadowing the others. The screen time is balanced so well; every second is used to show something important about the story or the characters. No one overacts or steals the show, and that makes it feel even more real."", ""As usual I watched the movie without reading reviews or the plot. I discovered this Thai tile because it was in the recommended 2024 foreign movies in couple of websites.\n\nI am sure this movie will resonate with whoever is a little older, lets say older than 25, all the memories about the time spent with your grandparents will inevitably come up at some point. I suppose we all had grandparents that were not good at expressing their feeling with words, but their actions and generosity are in our memories.\n\nThe plot is simple. I really appreciate that the whole thing is handed in a very nice way, a good dose of humour, jokes and bickering and a good dose of serious family moments. I enjoyed that they didn't go into the melodramatic over the top emotional moments. It is 2 hours long but it went very fast. The plot twist at the end is a nice touch and surprise.\n\nAll the actors and characters looked real. Grandma is totally adorable.\n\nAnd Yes I am pretty sure that a tissue will be needed at some point."", ""This film is a thought-provoking Thai family drama that centers around M, a young man who quits his job to care for his terminally ill grandmother, hoping to inherit her wealth. However, as time passes, his motivations shift, and he forms a deeper bond with her, leading to moments of reflection and emotional growth. The movie touches on universal themes such as family dynamics, the desire for material wealth, and the regret that often comes when it's too late to fully appreciate the people we love. While the premise may seem driven by greed, the film's real strength lies in its exploration of human relationships and the way we come to understand our elders only when faced with their mortality. I do feel the pacing drags in the middle, and that we are all waiting for that emotional payoff and the development of the relationship between M and Amah. If you're looking for a film that will make you reflect on life, love, and the passage of time, How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies is definitely worth watching. It's a touching reminder that sometimes the real treasure is not material wealth, but the connections we forge with our loved ones."", ""The title is paradoxical to the sentiment of the movie. The title sounds cunning while the movie is heart-warming.\n\nScarcity of money meets the caring for the near-&-dear ones. There is a struggle for money, yet there is a sense of filial piety and affection too. & there is no either-or here. Rather, there is only 'and' to it. The grandma gets cared for while the calculations are also happening for receiving the inheritance. One of the most unique moments in the movie is when the terminally ill grandma visits her brother to ask for her share of the inheritance from her parents. Unfortunately, the elderly brother denies sharing the inheritance."", ""M is persuaded to take care of his grandma Mengju after he witnesses his paternal grandfather's primary carer Mui inherit his estate. M is an university dropout and a gamer, tries to impress his grandmother by taking care of her, after she gets diagnosed with stage four cancer. Mengju adores her children - M's mother Sew, sons Kiang and Soei. She wishes to be buried in a big plot so that her children can get together to visit her. As M bonds with Mengju, despite hoping for monetary gain, the strong grandmother-grandson relationship makes him realize what it trult means to care for another person.\n\nThis was indeed a very emotional film for me and the story is such, it is impossible to not connect with these characters. The characters were so beautifully written that even Mui gets a perfect emotional scene towards the end when she speaks about her grandfather. M's transformation throughout the film is indeed worth watching for and the scenes with his mother Sew were equally heart touching. The true highlight was Mengju and M's bonding, I couldn't really pin point individual scenes as my favorite. I definitely was teary eyed in couple scenes until that entire climax bit with M describing Mengju about their journey. This easily became the best film I watched in 2024 and also is one of my all time favorites. Highly recommended to everyone."", ""This is the kind of story that effortlessly captures people's hearts, the emotional weight was already on from the very beginning, but what makes How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies even more impactful is its deeply relatable characters, watching this film is like observing a real, complicated family on screen, thanks to the exceptional performances by the cast, they bring such authenticity to their roles that it feels as though they truly are a family, and that one big important aspects of the film is what makes it an incredible piece of cinema, added again with Jaithep Raroengjai beautiful and emotional score in the background, it adds an emotional depth that elevates the entire experience, making it one of the year's best movie score, and this film as a whole was a great emotional ride, a powerful emotional journey packed into two hours of compelling storytelling and outstanding character development, it's undeniably one of the best films of the year, and yes, it's a tears dropping guaranteed."", '""Lahn Mah"" is a captivating Thai drama that blends heartfelt storytelling with strong character development, creating an emotionally resonant experience.\n\nEngaging Plot: The film centers around the lives of its main characters, exploring their relationships, struggles, and personal growth with sensitivity and depth.\n\nStrong Performances: The cast delivers heartfelt performances, bringing authenticity and emotional intensity to their roles, making the characters\' journeys compelling and relatable.\n\nBeautiful Cinematography: The film features stunning visuals that capture the essence of its setting, enhancing the narrative with atmospheric and visually appealing scenes.\n\nEmotional Depth: ""Lahn Mah"" delves into themes of love, loss, and redemption, offering a thought-provoking and emotionally rich story that resonates with viewers.']",https://ingresso-a.akamaihd.net/prd/img/movie/como-ganhar-milhoes-antes-que-a-avo-morra/2121657f-c277-42ec-ac7f-6c3bd09db3c2.webp
